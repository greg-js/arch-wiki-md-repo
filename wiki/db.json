Anyone eavesdropping on your connection will not be able to intercept and crack your password because it is never actually transmitted.  Additionally, using SSH keys for authentication virtually eliminates the risk posed by brute-force password attacks by drastically reducing the chances of the attacker correctly guessing the proper credentials.","category":false,"url":"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys","path":"_content/SSH keys.md"},{"title":"Sshguard","description":"sshguard is a daemon that protects SSH and other services against brute-force attacks, similar to fail2ban.","category":false,"url":"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sshguard","path":"_content/Sshguard.md"},{"title":"VPN over SSH","description":"There are several ways to set up a Virtual Private Network through SSH.

Because the libraries can move around in memory, this causes a performance penalty, and the more libraries that need to be resolved, the greater the penalty. Prelink reduces this penalty by using the system's dynamic linker to reversibly perform this linking in advance (\"prelinking\" the executable file) by relocating. Afterward, the program only needs to spend time finding the relevant libraries on being run if, for some reason (perhaps an upgrade), the libraries have changed since being prelinked.","category":false,"url":"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Prelink","path":"_content/Prelink.md"},{"title":"Preload","description":"Preloading is the action of putting and keeping target files into the RAM.
