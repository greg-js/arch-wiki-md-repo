Unless you intend to serve NTP to networked clients or want to connect to local hardware clocks this simple NTP client should be more than appropriate for most installations. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct.

This will run wpasupplicant on the wireless interface and DHCP and DHCPv6 daemons on a virtual bond0 interface. This is useful, for instance, with a portable computer when you want to use the wired interface for speed and/or security when available, and the wireless interface when the wired interface is not available. The basic idea is to have two always active wired and wireless interfaces, then bond or enslave them to a virtual interface master, and then let the kernel bonding module handle switching between the interfaces. Of course, this scheme can be extended to two wireless interfaces or to more than two physical network interfaces. Note that no other connection manager is used here, for those who prefer a more basic approach. But then also, note that wpasupplicant itself can be managed directly using `wpagui` from wpasupplicantgui or wpasupplicant_gui-qt5, to scan for, select, and connect to new access points/base stations."},{"pageid":1010,"title":"Wireless network configuration","length":50765,"lastrevid":423440,"url":"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration","lastMod":"2016-02-29T03:36:17Z","mdPath":"_content/english/Wireless network configuration.md","description":"Configuring wireless is a two-part process the first part is to identify and ensure the correct driver for your wireless device is installed (they are available on the installation media, but often have to be installed explicitly), and to configure the interface.
