From [sxhkd's Github page](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd):

_sxhkd is a simple X hotkey daemon with a powerful and compact configuration syntax._

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [sxhkd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=sxhkd) or [sxhkd-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sxhkd-git/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup>.

## Configuration

sxhkd defaults to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxhkd/sxhkdrc` for its configuration file. An alternate configuration file can be specified with the `-c` option.

Each line of the configuration file is interpreted as so:

*   If it starts with `#`, it is ignored.
*   If it starts with one or more white space commands, it is read as a command.
*   Otherwise, it is parsed as a hotkey: each key name is separated by spaces and/or `+` characters.

General syntax:

```
[MODIFIER + ]*[@|!]KEYSYM
    COMMAND

```

Where `MODIFIER` is one of the following names: `super`, `hyper`, `meta`, `alt`, `control`, `ctrl`, `shift`, `mode_switch`, `lock`, `mod1`, `mod2`, `mod3`, `mod4`, `mod5`. If `@` is added at the beginning of the keysym, the command will be run on key release events, otherwise on key press events. If `!` is added at the beginning of the keysym, the command will be run on motion notify events and must contain two integer conversion specifications which will be replaced by the x and y coordinates of the pointer relative to the root window referential (the only valid button keysyms for this type of hotkeys are: `button1`, ..., `button5`). The `KEYSYM` names are those your will get from `xev`.

Mouse hotkeys can be defined by using one of the following special keysym names: `button1`, `button2`, `button3`, ..., `button24`. The hotkey can contain a sequence of the form (`STRING_1`,â€¦,`STRING_N`), in which case, the command must also contain a sequence with _N_ elements: the pairing of the two sequences generates _N_ hotkeys. In addition, the sequences can contain ranges of the form `A-Z` where _A_ and _Z_ are alphanumeric characters.

What is actually executed is `SHELL -c COMMAND`, which means you can use environment variables in `COMMAND`. `SHELL` will be the content of the first defined environment variable in the following list: `SXHKD_SHELL`, `SHELL`. If sxhkd receives a `SIGUSR1` signal, it will reload its configuration file.

## Usage

After configuring it, you may wish to setup sxhkd to [autostart](/index.php/Autostart "Autostart").

**Tip:** An example [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") service file is found [here](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd/blob/master/contrib/systemd/sxhkd.service).
