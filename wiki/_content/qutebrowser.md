[qutebrowser](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser) is a lightweight keyboard-driven, vim-like browser based on PyQt5 and QtWebKit.

## Installation

The [qutebrowser](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qutebrowser/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> and [qutebrowser-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qutebrowser-git/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> packages can be installed.

## Basic usage

Use `:` to access the command prompt. You can use `Tab` to auto-complete.

On first usage of qutebrowser, a Quickstart page appears. It is later accessible via `:help`. See the [cheatsheet](http://qutebrowser.org/img/cheatsheet-big.png) for keyboard shortcuts.

### user configuration

You will find the configuration files of qutebrowser in your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME (or ~/.config)` under `qutebrowser/`. The main configuration happens in the file qutebrowser.conf, which is organized in sections like an ini-file. For example, under [searchengines] you can configure your search engines as described by the comment. To add a shortcut for searching the the arch wiki, add these two lines:

```
archwiki = [https://wiki.archlinux.org/?search={}](https://wiki.archlinux.org/?search={})
aw = ${archwiki}

```

Now - in qutebrowser - you can search the arch wiki for an article about qutebrowser via `:open aw qutebrowser` which will bring you to this page. As per the standard configuration the key mapping 'o' will subsituteÂ :open, so typing `o aw <your search term>` will henceforth allow you to quickly search the arch wiki. Notice that the arguments required to perform a search vary across search engines, for example, to set up google use:

```
google = [https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q={}](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q={})
g = ${google}

```
