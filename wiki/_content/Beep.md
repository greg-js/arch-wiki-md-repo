Beep is an advanced PC speaker beeping program. It is useful for situations where no sound card and/or speakers are available, and simple audio notification is desired.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [beep](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=beep) package.

## Configuration

### Access for non-root users

By default `beep` will fail if not run by the root. Other users may call it using [sudo](/index.php/Sudo "Sudo"). To let group `users` call `sudo beep` without a password (for example to use it in scripts), `/etc/sudoers` [should be edited](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sudo#Using_visudo):

```
%users ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/beep

```

or, to let only a single user do that:

```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/beep

```

Another way is setting the sticky bit on `/usr/bin/beep`:

```
# chmod 4755 /usr/bin/beep

```

Note however that this way **anyone** can execute `/usr/bin/beep` with root permissions. The change also creates a difference between local copy and the package, which will be reported by `pacman -Qkk`.

### Unmuting in alsamixer

You should also unmute the Beep channel using `alsamixer`.

```
$ alsamixer

```

You may need to press `F6` and select your card. scroll to the Beep channel using the arrow keys and press `M` to unmute the channel. notice that the "MM" label below the channel will change to "00". you can also use `â†‘` to increase the volume of the channel.

Press `Esc` to close alsamixer.

You can also save your settings to ALSA Mixer to make it permanent:

```
# alsactl -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state store

```

## Tips and Tricks

While many people are happy with the traditional beep sound, some may like to change its properties a bit. The following example plays slighly higher and shorter sound and repeats it two times.

```
# beep -f 5000 -l 50 -r 2

```
