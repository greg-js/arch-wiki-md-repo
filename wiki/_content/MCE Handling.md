# MCE Handling

From ArchWiki

Jump to: [navigation](#column-one), [search](#searchInput)

This article aims to help users implement services to actively monitor, log, and report hardware errors. A machine check exception (MCE) is an error generated by the CPU when the CPU detects that a hardware error or failure has occurred.

## Introduction

Machine check exceptions (MCEs) can occur for a variety of reasons ranging from undesired or out-of-spec voltages from the power supply, from cosmic radiation flipping bits in memory DIMMs or the CPU, or from other miscellaneous faults, including faulty software triggering hardware errors.

## Installing mcelog

The [mcelog](http://www.mcelog.org/) daemon written by Andi Kleen is one of the tools one can use to gather MCE information.

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [mcelog](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=mcelog) package from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

## Configuring mcelog

mcelog's configuration file is located at `/etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf`.

### Running mcelog as a daemon

It is recommended by upstream to always run mcelog as a daemon, so edit `/etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf` and set `daemon = yes`.

Finally, start the mcelog service and enable it to start automatically on boot:

```
# systemctl start mcelog
# systemctl enable mcelog

```
