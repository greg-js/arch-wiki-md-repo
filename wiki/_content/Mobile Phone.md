# Mobile Phone

## iPhone

You will need [libimobiledevice-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libimobiledevice-git/) and [libgpod-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libgpod-git/) compiled with afc support. You can use the [ifuse-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ifuse-git/) to mount your [iPod](/index.php/IPod "IPod") or if you use [GNOME](/index.php/GNOME "GNOME") you can compile [Gvfs](/index.php/Gvfs "Gvfs") with the option `--with-afc` [[1]](https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/gvfs).

For more info see the [iPod](/index.php/IPod#iPhone.2FiPod_Touch "IPod") page.

## CDMA

[CDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDMA "wikipedia:CDMA") includes phones on Samsung, LG, Sanyo, and more.

Right now there is no easy way to use CDMA phones. The best option is Bitpim.

You can use the latest version of [bitpim-release](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bitpim-release/) for these phones. Make sure you run Bitpim as root and everything should work.
