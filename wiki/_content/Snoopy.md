Jump to: [navigation](#column-one), [search](#searchInput)

Snoopy is a program similar to Warcraft III Banlist, aimed at improving the experience of Warcraft III players on Battle.net. Though focused on hosting, snoopy can be useful for any users as it allows for pinging, location checks, friends list following, and more. Snoopy is a native program built to use with [WarCraft III](/index.php/WarCraft_III "WarCraft III") on [Wine](/index.php/Wine "Wine").

## Installation

Snoopy can be found in the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") as package [snoopy](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/snoopy/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup><sup>[[broken link](/index.php/ArchWiki:Requests#Broken_package_links "ArchWiki:Requests"): archived in [aur-mirror](http://pkgbuild.com/git/aur-mirror.git/tree/snoopy)]</sup>.

## Getting started

### Snoopy programs

Snoopy installs three programs in the `/usr/bin` directory:

*   `snoopy-sh` is a not so useful on arch script intended to run snoopy-nox for the current user. Ignore this.
*   `snoopy-ping` is a frontend to the ping command that snoopy uses to ping. Feel free to ignore this too.
*   `snoopy-nox` is the primary program that snoopy runs. This is all we're really going to worry about.

### Executing snoopy

Snoopy can be executed in either of the following ways. The alias approach is a single-user solution, as opposed to the script which will work for all users.

#### Snoopy alias

A simple way to get snoopy working is to use an alias.

*   First edit your .bashrc file, add the following line as a new line with your interface (for example "enp1s0"):

 `~/.bashrc`  `alias snoopy-sh-local='sudo snoopy-nox enp1s0 $(id -u) $(id -g)'` 

*   For this time you have to run:

```
 $ source ~/.bashrc

```

This command re-reads your .bashrc and is afterwards not necessary because your .bashrc is read on every login.

#### Snoopy script

You can make your own script to run snoopy-nox. It takes three parameters: your network device, your uid, and your gid. These are necessary because snoopy must be run as root. We'll make a launch script.

First, if you do not know your network interface run:

```
# ip a

```

to determine what it is. A typical default ethernet interface name is enp1s0.

How you make your script is ultimately up to you. In my example I get the user's uid and gid using `id -u` and `id -g` respectively. I set the interface explicitly, enp1s0\. sudo is used because snoopy must be run as root. Here is an example script:

 `/usr/bin/snoopy-sh-local` 

```
#!/bin/bash
sudo snoopy-nox enp1s0 $(id -u) $(id -g)

```

When you've finished your simple script make sure it is executable:

```
# chmod 755 /usr/bin/snoopy-sh-local

```

Now snoopy should now work properly. It is up to you how you want to run it with regards to Warcraft 3\. It shouldn't matter whether you start snoopy before or after Warcraft 3\. Perhaps you'll want to change your script to run Warcraft 3 as well after snoopy starts.

### Allowing sudo for snoopy

You might want to allow nopassword sudo for snoopy. First, edit the sudo config file:

```
# visudo

```

Add a line like the following.Â %wheel can be replaced with specific usernames if desired, otherwise it'll work for any users in the wheel group.

```
%wheel ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/snoopy-nox

```
