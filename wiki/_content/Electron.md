# Electron

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), formerly known as Atom Shell, is an application developed by GitHub to build cross platform desktop apps using web technologies. The most famous example of desktop apps built on Electron is the [Atom](/index.php/Atom "Atom") text editor.

## Installation

Electron is available is the following forms:

*   as a ready to install package from the unofficial [[atom]](/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#atom "Unofficial user repositories") repository
*   from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/electron/)

Notice that the AUR package uses precompiled binaries downloaded from GitHub, while the package from [[atom]](/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#atom "Unofficial user repositories") repository is compiled from source.
