## Emulators

An emulator is a program which serves to replicate the functions of another platform or system so as to allow applications and games to be run in environments they were not programmed for. While emulators themselves are not games in a strict sense, they provide users with the ability to play games and therefore have been included in this article.

**Warning:** Emulators provide users with the ability to run programs called "ROMS", which are copies of games. While owning an emulator itself is not illegal, downloading or sharing (and in some cases, creating) copyrighted ROMs without the copyright holder's permission is ILLEGAL. Using an emulator to run ROMs that you do not own the legal rights to is ILLEGAL. Use at your own risk and be sure to read the Terms of Service for the emulator. Arch Linux etc. is not responsible if you get in trouble.

*   [Minecraft](/index.php/Minecraft "Minecraft") - A java based game that you can buy while still in beta for $15, but has a limited free to play version. Very addictive game, big community, lot of updates, don't miss this one.

*   [Book of Eschalon I and II](http://basiliskgames.com/) - Classical isometric RPG like Ultima, Might & Magic or Wizardry.

**Tip:** If running on a low resolution (netbook etc) either play it on external monitor, but you can't see the skill/action bar. You can move the Window pressing alt+left_mouse. You can see the action bar, but then you can't see the health bar anymore. Email Michael from linuxgamepublishing.com and ask for a fix - would be really great if we could fully enjoy this game on Linux netbooks
