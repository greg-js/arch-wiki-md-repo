Article based on [Acer Aspire 1652 ZWLMi](/index.php?title=Acer_Aspire_1652_ZWLMi&action=edit&redlink=1 "Acer Aspire 1652 ZWLMi (page does not exist)"), which in turn was based on [Acer Aspire 1691 WLMi](/index.php/Acer_Aspire_1691_WLMi "Acer Aspire 1691 WLMi").

This notebook was a very economic solution, at about $500 two years ago that still works like a charm. The combination of a economic processor such as the Celeron M 380 and a lightweight Linux distribution such as Arch Linux with a minimalist usability focus like using the fluxbox window manager, all of that makes a great deal of this laptop, currently used for programming in many environments and paradigms, music listening, video watching and the all-time classic web surfing and mail checking.

Currently using a custom mainline kernel with no modules other than the additional madwifi Atheros drivers, expecting to use the ath5k drivers in the 2.6.25 kernel. Also, the hard disk uses three partitions, a root partition, an encrypted home partition and the swap.

Battery life currently tops 2 hours when just coding or writing with WiFi enabled and about 1:20 while watching h.264 video files.

The modem and PCMCIA slot have never been used.

# Installing Arch Linux

Installed two times with the standard CD, about two years ago (2006) and a fresh reinstall in November 2007, the upgraded the system with pacman -Syu and added all my favorite packages.

# Kernel

Currently using a customized configuration 2.6.23.1 kernel with support only for the included hardware and some extra USB stuff.

# Power Management

Turning it off when not used and DPMS screen shutdown in the xorg.conf file. Have not used suspend to disk, boot time is very fast, about 20 seconds from button press to login.

# Xorg

The intel driver doesn't like to set the DPI according to forced physical dimensions, so there is a trick to get the desired DPI (81x81). In the user's ~/.bashrc the following line was added:

```
alias xinit='xinit -- -dpi 81'

```

So that when issuing the xinit command, it will always use that DPI resolution.

## DPMS screen shutdown

The following /etc/X11/xorg.conf snippet adds a DPMS screen shutdown after 5 minutes of no activity.

```
Section "Monitor"
    ...
    Option "DPMS" "true"
    ...
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
    ...
    Option "OffTime" "5" 
    ...
EndSection

```
