# Concurrent Versions System

_"[Concurrent Versions System](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/) is a version control system, an important component of Source Configuration Management (SCM). Using it, you can record the history of sources files, and documents. It fills a similar role to the free software RCS, PRCS, and Aegis packages."_

This is a quick guide on how to set up the latest CVS server.

## Installation

Update or install to the latest version of cvs and xinetd (as root):

```
# pacman -S cvs xinetd

```

Create the cvs group - members of this group will have write access to the repository (as root):

```
# groupadd cvs

```

Create the cvs user in the cvs group (-md makes the home directory) (as root):

```
# useradd -md /home/cvsroot -g cvs -p Insecure0 cvs

```

## Initialization

Initialize your CVS repository (as cvs):

```
cvs% cvs -d /home/cvsroot init

```

The permissions on the directory (not the files inside, however) should be 2775 (drwxrwxr-x), but if not, run (as cvs):

```
cvs% chmod 2775 /home/cvsroot

```

Add any users that you want to have local access to the repository to the group cvs by using the following two steps. You can add pre-existing users to the cvs group with the command (as root):

```
# gpasswd -a username cvs

```

Make a file in `/etc/xinetd.d/` called cvspserver with these contents (as root):

```
service cvspserver
{
        port            = 2401
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        passenv         = /home/cvsroot
        server          = /usr/bin/cvs
        server_args     = -f --allow-root=/home/cvsroot pserver
}

```

Edit `/etc/services` and add this line containing the information for cvspserver service if does not exist (as root):

```
cvspserver 2401/tcp     #CVS PServer

```

Unset the variable HOME before you restart xinetd:

```
# unset HOME

```

Now restart xinetd (as root):

```
/etc/rc.d/xinetd restart

```

## Configuration

Become cvs ("su cvs") and create a 'passwd' file in `~/CVSROOT`. To add entries in the file you can use htpasswd command (present in the apache package) like that:

```
htpasswd -b filename username password

```

then edit che file and add che group, should look like this:

```
# Format is username:password:group

anonymous::
luser:HopefullySecure0:cvs
other:Insecure0:cvs

```

Now create a 'writers' file in `~/CVSROOT`, which grants write privileges to the users you created in 'passwd':

```
luser
other

```

Now create a 'readers' file in `~/CVSROOT`, which grants read privileges to the users you created in 'passwd':

```
anonymous

```

**Note:** If a user is present in the readers file cannot have write access too.

## Use

You can test out the server using the following commands:

```
export CVSROOT=:pserver:my_user_name@127.0.0.1:/home/cvsroot
cvs login
mkdir ~/sandbox
mkdir ~/sandbox/myproject
cd ~/sandbox/myproject
echo "this is a sample file" > myfile
cvs import -m "description of myproject" myproject v1 r1
cd ..
rm -R myproject
cvs checkout myproject
cd myproject
echo "some changes to the file" >> myfile
cvs commit -m "Explain changes here" myfile

```
