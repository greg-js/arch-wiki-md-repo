From the [project web page](http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki):

_Gobby is a free collaborative editor supporting multiple documents in one session and a multi-user chat._ It uses GTK+ 2.6 as its windowing toolkit and thus integrates nicely into the GNOME desktop environment.

## Installation

Gobby .4 is in the community repo as package [gobby](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gobby). To run the Infininote server protocol without the Gobby front end install [libinfinity](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=libinfinity)

The newer development version .5 (0.4.94-1 at the time of writing) is available in AUR as package [gobby-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gobby-git/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup><sup>[[broken link](/index.php/ArchWiki:Requests#Broken_package_links "ArchWiki:Requests"): archived in [aur-mirror](http://pkgbuild.com/git/aur-mirror.git/tree/gobby-git)]</sup>

## Infininote Usage

To start the server portion, run

```
/usr/bin/infinoted-0.6 --security-policy=no-tls

```

The server only needs to be running on one machine.

Then, run the gobby client and connect to the server via IP or localhost.

If youâ€™d rather have encryption, TLS is available. Use:

```
infinoted-0.6 --create-key --create-certificate -k key.pem  -c cert.pem

```

The keys creation is automatic, and you can launch the server just using:

```
infinoted-0.6 -k key.pem  -c cert.pem

```
