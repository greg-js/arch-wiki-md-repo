## Methods to Play

### Rsu-client (Recommended)

**Note:** If you are unable to install the client from the AUR because of a problem with [perl-wx](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/perl-wx/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup>, remove it from the [depends array](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD#depends). [perl-wx](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/perl-wx/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> is needed for the [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). The client will work fine without it, but you will not have a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).

Rsu-client is an unofficial RuneScape Unix/Linux Client and it's currently the recommended way to play RuneScape/Old School RuneScape. It's available to install from the AUR [unix-runescape-client](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/unix-runescape-client/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup>, or you can manually grab the source at [https://github.com/HikariKnight/rsu-client](https://github.com/HikariKnight/rsu-client). After installation, to start playing, open either “RuneScape” or “RuneScape OldSchool”, depending on what version you are interested in.

### HTML5 RuneScape 3 Beta Client

[There is an official HTML5 webclient available for RuneScape](https://www.runescape.com/game?html5=1) which can be used in your browser of choice. RuneScape cannot be played with [google-chrome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/google-chrome/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup>/[chromium](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=chromium) because they no longer support the Java plug-in required for the client. As the client is currently in beta and still being optimized, it's liable to crashes and bugs, please take additional care during challenging gameplay that could result in the loss of your items. More information and about browser support can be found at: [https://www.runescape.com/browser-support](https://www.runescape.com/browser-support)

### OSBuddy (Old School RuneScape only)

OSBuddy is a third-party toolkit for Old School RuneScape which in addition to a client offers useful features, such as highscores, notes, price checker etc. It's available for installation from the AUR, [osbuddy](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/osbuddy/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup>.
