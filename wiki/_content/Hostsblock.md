[hostsblock](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hostsblock/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> is a bash script for Linux designed to take advantage of the HOSTS file available in all operating systems to provide system-wide blocking of internet advertisements, malicious domains, trackers, and other undesirable content. To do so, it downloads a configurable set of blocklists and processes and their entries into a singular HOSTS file.
