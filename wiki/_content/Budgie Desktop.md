Budgie is the default desktop of Solus Operating System, written from scratch. Besides a more modern design, Budgie can emulate the look and feel of the GNOME 2 desktop.

At this time Budgie is heavily under development, so you can expect minor bugs and new features to be added as time goes on.

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [budgie-desktop](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/budgie-desktop/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> package for the latest stable or [budgie-desktop-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/budgie-desktop-git/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> for current git master.

For additional settings, install [gnome-tweak-tool](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gnome-tweak-tool).

### Starting

Choose _Budgie Desktop_ session from a [display manager](/index.php/Display_manager "Display manager") of choice, or modify [xinitrc](/index.php/Xinitrc "Xinitrc") to include Budgie Desktop:
