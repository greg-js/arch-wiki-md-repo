## Installation

I worked through this HowTo: [Beginners' guide](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide "Beginners' guide")

## Kernel

The stock Arch kernel works just fine.

## Networking

My Network was extremely slow. This was caused by an IPv6 problem. After adding the following line in the `/etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf` everything was ok.

```
alias net-pf-10 off

```

### Wired

Works out of the box.

### Wireless

#### Broadcom Corporation BCM4311

Install [broadcom-wl](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/broadcom-wl/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> from [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

For getting the network up automatically, I copied the file `/etc/network.d/examples/wpa.example` (take the example file for your use case) into the directory `/etc/network.d/` and renamed it (e.g. `wlan_profile`) and edited it. Then I added the following line to `/etc/rc.conf`:

```
NETWORKS=(wlan_profile)

```

And added the following daemon in the `/etc/rc.conf`:

```
DAEMONS=( ... net-profiles ... )

```

### Modem

I have not tried the modem to see if it works.
