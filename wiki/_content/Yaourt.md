**Warning:** Yaourt is an unofficial, third-party script that is **not** supported by the Arch Linux developers. Report bugs at the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt/issues).

[Yaourt](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt) (**Y**et **A**n**O**ther **U**ser **R**epository **T**ool) is a wrapper for pacman which adds automated access to the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") using the same syntax as [pacman](/index.php/Pacman "Pacman").

## Installation

First install [package-query](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/package-query/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> as a dependency, and then the [yaourt](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yaourt/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> package itself. Since both those packages are available from the AUR, you will have to install them with the official method for installing unsupported packages, which is exhaustively described in the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") article. It is important that you understand what "unsupported package" really means, and you can take this as an opportunity to learn what are the operations that [AUR helpers](/index.php/AUR_helpers "AUR helpers") like yaourt make automatic.

Alternatively, add the unofficial [archlinuxfr](/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#archlinuxfr "Unofficial user repositories") repository.
