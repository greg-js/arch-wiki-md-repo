# CyberPower UPS

This document describes how to install the CyberPower UPS daemon. The main advantage of using a CyberPower UPS is that it is cheap and it can communicate with your Linux box through either a RS-232 or USB serial connection. In the event of a prolonged power outage, should the CyberPower UPS lose most of its battery capacity, it can tell the Linux box to perform a safe shutdown.

## Installation

Install powerpanel ([powerpanel](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/powerpanel/)) from [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

## Configuration

Edit `/etc/pwrstatd.conf`

Email notifications can be accomplished by editing `/etc/powerpanel/pwrstatd-powerfail.sh` and `/etc/powerpanel/pwrstatd-lowbatt.sh`

**Warning:** Make sure the path to the email script at the bottom of these scripts is correct. It should be `/etc/powerpanel/pwrstatd-email.sh`

## Running

Start and enable the service

```
# systemctl start pwrstatd
# systemctl enable pwrstatd

```

Then run `# pwrstat -status`

You should get something like this:

```

The UPS information shows as following:
