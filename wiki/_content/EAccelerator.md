# EAccelerator

eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator & optimizer. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.

## Installation

Download the tarball from [eaccelerator](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eaccelerator/) or use your favorite tool for AUR.

IMPORTANT: If you are having problems with open_basedir, you need to edit the PKGBUILD, change the ./configure line to

```
./configure --without-eaccelerator-use-inode --prefix=/usr

```

I recommend that you do it anyway since future versions of eAccelerator won't be using inodes. You can find more info here: [http://eaccelerator.net/ticket/104#comment:13](http://eaccelerator.net/ticket/104#comment:13)

Compile the package with

```
makepkg -s

```

## Enable it in PHP

After the discussion here and the guidance by Spider.007 (also the maintainer of the AUR package) it is clear that you should do nothing special in order for eAccelerator to work.

## Check if installation was ok

You can either from the command line or using phpinfo(). If the command line php binary uses the same configuration file as the php-fastcgi version and/or the mod_php version, you can check it by executing:

```
$ php -v

```

If installation was succesfull you should see something similar to the following:

```
Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2011 Zend Technologies
   with eAccelerator v0.9.6.1, Copyright (c) 2004-2010 eAccelerator, by eAccelerator

```

This will show eAccelerator has been loaded successfully, but this doesn't necessarily show that eAccelerator is working like it should. Load a php script running on your webserver in your browser. Assuming you didn't disable the filecache with shm_only = 1, a cached script should appear in the cache directory.

You could/should also check using phpinfo(). To do so add:

```
<?php
  phpinfo();
?>

```

to a file and open it with your browser. eAccelerator should have its own section.

## Troubleshooting

If you get this error

```
PHP Warning:  Module 'eAccelerator' already loaded in Unknown on line 0

```

Then eAccelerator is loaded twice in your config files. Make sure you are not loading eAccelerator in both php.ini and its own config file. If you followed this wiki you shouldn't be having this problem.

If after upgrading php (through pacman) you get this

```
[eAccelerator] This build of "eAccelerator" was compiled for PHP version 5.3.6\. Rebuild it for your PHP version (5.3.8) or download precompiled binaries.

```

Then uninstall eAccelerator (I did a pacman -Rcsun eaccelerator), rebuild it from AUR and reinstall. Everything should be fine once again.
