### UEFI

The G750 is a UEFI device, but can also boot from a partition with the "boot" flag set in the traditional manner. Both UEFI and legacy boot methods work with [syslinux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=syslinux) using the instructions on the wiki [here](/index.php/Syslinux "Syslinux").

### Graphics

Works fine with [nvidia](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nvidia) from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories"). The [xf86-video-nouveau](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-nouveau) driver has not yet been tested.

 `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`

#### HDMI port

HDMI video output works using the proprietary video driver. HDMI audio output works using [pulseaudio](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=pulseaudio).

#### VGA port

Works using the proprietary video driver.

#### DisplayPort over Thunderbolt port

Works using the proprietary video driver.

### Touchpad

Does not quite work out-of-the-box with [xf86-input-synaptics](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-synaptics) from the official repositories. The touchpad is mistakenly recognized as a click-pad, leading to the right mouse button being disabled and some other strange behaviour. A fix to enable the right physical button is available [here](http://superuser.com/questions/619582/right-elantech-touchpad-button-not-working-in-linux).

**UPDATE 2014-04-01** - The above has been fixed in [kernel 3.13.8 (Input: elantech - improve clickpad detection)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/ChangeLog-3.13.8). Physical right touchpad button now confirmed working on a G750JX.

To remedy the other strange behaviour (a left-click is interpreted as a right-click if a finger is touching the lower-right area of the touchpad), the following options are required:

 `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf` 

```
        Option "SoftButtonAreas" "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
        Option "RTCornerButton" "0" #right-click to bottom right

```

### USB 3

All USB ports work fine with no configuration required.

### Optical drive

Can read from and write to CD/DVD media with no configuration required. BD-ROM reading has not yet been tested.

### Sound

The integrated stero microphones work out-of-the-box with PulseAudio. The headphone and microphone ports also behave as expected. To get the bass speaker working, it is necessary to enable 2.1 sound in PulseAudio:

 `/etc/pulse/daemon.conf` 

```
        default-sample-channels = 3
        enable-lfe-remixing = yes

```

alsamixer from [alsa-utils](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=alsa-utils) maps the bass speaker to the "Speaker" channel, and maps the left and right speakers to the "Headphone" channel. PulseAudio jack detection can interfere with this configuration; to disable it, comment out this line:

 `/etc/pulse/default.pa` 

```
        # load-module module-switch-on-port-available

```

### Webcam

Works fine with no configuration required. The webcam records at a higher framerate than the sensor on the G73 and is actually usable, but it isn't anything special.

### SD card reader

Works fine with no configuration required. Note that the G750 is unable to boot from the card reader, even in legacy mode.

### Networking

#### LAN

Works fine with no configuration required.

#### WLAN

Works fine with no configuration required.

#### Bluetooth

Works fine using [bluez](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=bluez) with no configuration required.

### Untested

*   Data transfer over Thunderbolt port
*   BD-ROM reading
