### Meetup info

#### Meeting points

*   downtown meeting point: [entrance of "galerie ravenstein", at the central station](http://g.co/maps/d7xwp).
*   FOSDEM meeting point: at the door of the [Cross Distribution Devroom H.1301](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/room/h1301)

#### Meetups

*   Friday afternoon: some guys will do some sightseeing (or suggest something else). Everybody will probably arrive at different times so maybe meeting up at this stage is not convenient/suitable. However if you're interested, post here at which point you could make it to the downtown meeting point and maybe a meetup can be arranged
    *   Jan Steffens (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 13:35)
    *   Pierre Schmitz (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 13:35)
    *   Roman Kyrylych (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 11:51)
    *   Tom Gundersen (arrival Bruxelles-Midi 14:17)

*   Friday evening: meetup downtown @ 7PM at the downtown meeting point. We'll go out for dinner (made reservation @bigmama 7:15) and afterwards drinks. We'll visit the [FOSDEM beer event](http://fosdem.org/2012/beerevent) but it's usually insanely overcrowded so we'll probably go somewhere else.
