## Troubleshooting

### Touchpad and keyboard are not working

The solution is to add `i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset` to the end of the _kernel_ line of the grub menu config at `/boot/grub/menu.lst`.

Example:

```
# (0) Arch Linux
title  Arch Linux
root   (hd0,2)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda3 ro i8042.nomux=1 i8042.reset nomodeset quiet vga=0
initrd /boot/initramfs-linux.img
```

### Graphics

This model has the a6-3400m apu with an integrated radeon HD 6520g. This is problematic during the livecd install. If you do not hit tab at the arch boot screen and add "radeon.modeset=0" to the kernel line, you will end up with a black screen. After install, use the proprietary Catalyst driver if you want to make best use of the 3D support. As of 1/26/2012, the opensource driver has support for the gpu. The 2D support is better, especially for KDE effects. Under Catalyst, having parts of the plasma desktop become unresponsive for the entirety of the session, even after restart, is a known bug. Also, for sleep to work under catalyst, you must add the nomodeset and vga=0 options to grub, as shown above. This isn't required for the opensource driver. Sleep works more smoothly, and the console can use framebuffer support with KMS. For a smoother experience, xf86-video-ati is a better choice, but for opencl and better gaming support use catalyst.

### Audio

Alsa does not work. The central speaker, PCM, won't show up under alsa until pulseaudio is installed. Pulseaudio works perfectly with the audio system, even enabling mic input without a hitch. If you hear no sound, don't panic. Pulseaudio in later versions will automatically set the hmdi port as the default audio output. The solution is to go in and change the sound output on a single application that should be playing sound to the non-hdmi card. Pulseaudio learns quickly.

Vlc and skype have a known problem with pulseaudio on this soundcard. The scheduling leads to a "crackling" noise. To fix this,

Try adding tsched=0 to the load-module module-udev-detect line in /etc/pulse/default.pa so it reads:

```
 load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0

```

### Webcam

It is a v4l2 webcam, works perfectly.

### Hibernate/Suspend

There is a problem in which trying to sleep will cause a black screen, followed by flickers which persist until an acpi poweroff. Upon booting, the laptop will not make it to the bios until the battery and charger are removed. The fix for this is documented at [http://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug](http://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug)

Step 1: Create a file at /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom-ehci_hcd, with the following code:

```
#!/bin/sh
#inspired by [http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9744970&postcount=19](http://art.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9744970&postcount=19)

# tidied by tqzzaa :)

VERSION=1.1
DEV_LIST=/tmp/usb-dev-list
DRIVERS_DIR=/sys/bus/pci/drivers
DRIVERS="ehci xhci" # ehci_hcd, xhci_hcd
HEX="[[:xdigit:]]"
MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS=2
BIND_WAIT=0.1

unbindDev() {
  echo -n > $DEV_LIST 2>/dev/null
  for driver in $DRIVERS; do
    DDIR=$DRIVERS_DIR/${driver}_hcd
    for dev in `ls $DDIR 2>/dev/null | egrep "^$HEX+:$HEX+:$HEX"`; do
      echo -n "$dev" > $DDIR/unbind
      echo "$driver $dev" >> $DEV_LIST
    done
  done
}

bindDev() {
  if [ -s $DEV_LIST ]; then
    while read driver dev; do
      DDIR=$DRIVERS_DIR/${driver}_hcd
      while [ $((MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS)) -gt 0 ]; do
          echo -n "$dev" > $DDIR/bind
          if [ ! -L "$DDIR/$dev" ]; then
            sleep $BIND_WAIT
          else
            break
          fi
          MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS=$((MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS-1))
      done  
    done < $DEV_LIST
  fi
  rm $DEV_LIST 2>/dev/null
}

case "$1" in
  hibernate|suspend) unbindDev;;
  resume|thaw)       bindDev;;
esac

```

Step 2: Make this file executable with this command:

sudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom-ehci_hcd

Step 3: Enjoy. The screen still flickers, but the laptop goes into proper sleep.
