# Acer Aspire 5560G-7809

An affordable gaming laptop. The 5560G-7809 has an integrated GPU and a dedicated one a AMD 7640M. It's a good video card for a laptop in 2012 for gaming. It is part of the [Southern Islands (HD 7xxx) series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_AMD_graphics_processing_units#Southern_Islands_.28HD_7xxx.29_series). Since North Island (released beginning of 2011) still hasnt' gotten the full features implemented almost two years after release for the open-source driver, I don't expect the 7640M [feature matrix](http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature) to be complete until about 2014 sometime. Since I like gaming I will have to use the [Catylyst driver](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ATI_Catalyst).
