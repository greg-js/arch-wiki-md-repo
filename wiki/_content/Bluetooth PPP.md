# Bluetooth PPP

I forget how to pair devices, so this article is woefully lacking!!!

I'm no expert, but this page is to help people who want to setup a TCP connection from a Palm Pilot or other bluetooth device to their Arch Linux box. This is useful for browsing the Internet and/or performing a Hotsync operation.

I have no idea what really works, but this system is working for me right now!
