Parabola uses [its own repositories](https://wiki.parabola.nu/Repositories), which are almost identical to Arch's [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories"), but with non-free or problematic packages removed (see [blacklist](https://repo.parabola.nu/docs/blacklist.txt) for difference) and other free software replacements available.

### UBOS

UBOS focuses on making it easier and less time-consuming to install and maintain web applications on headless, personal servers and IoT devices. It currently exists for x86 and the Raspberry Pi. UBOS has several different release channels for different levels of maturity.

UBOS only contains those Arch packages that are needed for its purpose. But is also contains a range of web applications that owners of personal servers and/or IoT devices may want to run. Unusually, installation, upgrade, backup and other management operations of the included web applications are part of the "full-stack" tests performed in the UBOS release process.

Web applications can be fully deployed at a virtual host with a single command. This includes provisioning of databases, configuring web server, restarting daemons etc. depending on the needs of the application. Other single-command management includes undeployment, per-app or per-site or per-host backup and restore, and single-command full-system upgrade (code, data, and configuration of web apps).

## Meta distributions

### Archiso

[Archiso](/index.php/Archiso "Archiso") is a very simple set of bash scripts that allow for building live bootable CD/DVD/USB images based on Arch Linux. It uses a small uncomplicated code base and is actively developed. archiso is the tool used by Arch Linux to generate the official CD/USB images. It is a very generic tool, so it could potentially be used to generate anything from rescue systems, to install disks, to special interest live systems, and who knows what else. Simply put, if it involves Arch on a shiny coaster, it can do it.

*   Documentation: [Archiso - ArchWiki](/index.php/Archiso "Archiso")

## Live distributions

### Archboot

Archboot is designed for installation or rescue operations. It provides both the i686 and x86_64 architectures on one CD. It uses hwdetect and a different install script from the official Arch Linux install images. It runs in RAM using iniramfs, without any special filesystems like squashfs, thus it is limited to the RAM which is installed in your system.

## Arch-influenced distributions

### Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is a run-from-RAM linux distribution. Its original target was small appliances like routers, VPN gateways, or embedded x86 devices. However, it supports hosting other Linux guest OSes under VServer control, making it an attractive hosting solution as well. Though Alpine Linux may not actually be based on Arch, its [build system](http://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/tree/main/abuild/APKBUILD) is heavily inspired by Arch's.
