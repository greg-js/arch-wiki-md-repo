# Extra package cleanup

## Goals and ideas

*   A cleanup of the extra repository
*   Currently we have 441 orphans packages in [extra] (any, i686, x86_64)
*   Reduce the packaging work load of the developers
*   Minimise the number of apps per task
*   TUs are easier to appoint and find, it makes sense to move some of the workload to the community repo
*   Games should all go to community (except those that come with KDE and Gnome)

## Packages list

This packages will be moved to Unsupported, if you want to keep it in [extra] simply cross it out. Adoption is not required (but would be nice). If you are a TU and you want to maintain a package in [community] DO NOT cross it out, but add it to [#Candidate to .5Bcommunity.5D](#Candidate_to_.5Bcommunity.5D)
