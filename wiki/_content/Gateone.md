# Gateone

From [Gate One ✈ Web Terminal Emulator and SSH Client](http://liftoffsoftware.com/Products/GateOne):

	_Gate One™ is a web-based Terminal Emulator and SSH client that brings the power of the command line to the web. It requires no browser plugins and is built on top of a powerful plugin system that allows every aspect of its appearance and functionality to be customized._

Gate One enables users to access SSH servers over the web. alternatives exist, such as [Guacamole](http://guac-dev.org/). One of Gate One's distinguishing features is the ability to resume sessions from other browsers or to replay sessions.

This guide covers Gate One setup behind [nginx](/index.php/Nginx "Nginx") as reverse proxy.

## Installation

Gate One is available in the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") via [gateone-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gateone-git/).

### Optional dependencies

If you want to be able to upgrade (restart) Gate One without losing user's connected sessions you have to have dtach installed. This option is enabled by default in the configuration.

	[dtach](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dtach)

	emulates the detach feature of screen

## Configuration

**Warning:** By default gateone allows anonymous users to access the service. Please make sure to change the settings.

Following installation run gateone once to generate a default configuration with self generated ssl certificates.

```
# gateone

```

Let’s edit the configuration to suite your needs. There are three configuration files by default. located under `/etc/gateone/conf.d/`

All options are described at: [http://liftoff.github.io/GateOne/About/index.html#configuration](http://liftoff.github.io/GateOne/About/index.html#configuration)

Keep in mind that these options are split up in three configuration files: this article will deal with only some of them.

### Main settings

The main server settings are found in `/etc/gateone/conf.d/10server.conf`.

 `/etc/gateone/conf.d/10server.conf` 

```
{
    // "gateone" server-wide settings fall under "*"
    "*": {
        "gateone": { // These settings apply to all of Gate One
            "address": "",
            "ca_certs": null,
            "cache_dir": "/tmp/gateone_cache",
            "certificate": "/etc/gateone/ssl/certificate.pem",
            "combine_css": "",
            "combine_css_container": "gateone",
            "combine_js": "",
            "cookie_secret": "ZTRiOGUzNjM5ZmNjNDJjODllNDRmODk3Y2RjZTVlNTc4M",
            "debug": false,
            "disable_ssl": false,
            "embedded": false,
            "enable_unix_socket": false,
            "gid": "0",
            "https_redirect": false,
            "js_init": "",
            "keyfile": "/etc/gateone/ssl/keyfile.pem",
            "locale": "en_US",
            "log_file_max_size": 100000000,
            "log_file_num_backups": 10,
            "log_file_prefix": "/var/log/gateone/gateone.log",
            "log_to_stderr": null,
            "logging": "info",
            "origins": ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "10.1.1.100"],
            "pid_file": "/var/run/gateone.pid",
            "port": 443,
            "session_dir": "/tmp/gateone",
            "session_timeout": "5d",
            "syslog_facility": "daemon",
            "syslog_host": null,
            "uid": "0",
            "unix_socket_path": "/tmp/gateone.sock",
            "url_prefix": "/",
            "user_dir": "/var/lib/gateone/users",
            "user_logs_max_age": "30d"
        }
    }
}

```

`"address": ""` This tells Gate One to listen on all addresses. `"address": "localhost;::1;10.1.1.100"` Gate One will listen on localhost (IPv4 and IPv6) and on 10.1.1.100.

`"disable_ssl": false` or true, if you are handling SSL offloading somewhere else.

`"origins": ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "serverhostname", "10.1.1.100", "full.domain.name",` Add all URL's that will be used when connecting to Gate One. Failed attempts will be logged, look for "unknown origins" with systemctl status gateone

`"port": 443` What TCP port Gate One will listen on.

`"url_prefix": "/"` Specifies the URL path, if set to "/gateone/" the address will be [https://10.1.1.100/gateone/](https://10.1.1.100/gateone/)

### Authentication settings

The authentication settings are found in `/etc/gateone/conf.d/20authentication.conf`.

 `/etc/gateone/conf.d/20authentication.conf` 

```
// This is Gate One's authentication settings file.
{
    // "gateone" server-wide settings fall under "*"
    "*": {
        "gateone": { // These settings apply to all of Gate One
            "api_timestamp_window": "30s",
            "auth": "none",
            "pam_realm": "hostname",
            "pam_service": "login",
            "ssl_auth": "none",
            "sso_keytab": null,
            "sso_realm": null,
            "sso_service": "HTTP"
        }
    }
}

```

`"auth": "none"` Can be "none", "pam", google", "kerberos" or "api".

#### None

None is no authentication and allows anonymous access. Sessions will be tied to browser cookie.

#### PAM

PAM authentication can be used to authenticate with local users, but PAM can do much more. For example, you can authenticate against htpasswd files. Requires [libpam_pwdfile](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libpam_pwdfile/).

 `/etc/gateone/conf.d/20authentication.conf` 

```
 "auth": "pam"
 "pam_service": "gateonepwd"

```

Gate One uses Crypt encryption so use switch `-d`.

```
# htpasswd -c -d /etc/gateone/users.passwd user1

```

Create the PAM service file, please take care that all white spaces are `<TAB>` characters.

 `/etc/pam.d/gateonepwd` 

```
#%PAM-1.0
# Login using a htpasswd file
#@include common-sessionauth
auth required pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile /etc/gateone/users.passwd
account required pam_permit.so

```

#### Google

Google Authentication uses Google to authenticate (Gmail or Google+).

All authenticated modes enable you to resume your sessions on a different browser.

### Terminal settings

Here you can add terminals and options for them. For example using it to control what are accessible to Google authenticated users. For more information look here: [https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne/blob/master/gateone/applications/terminal/docs/configuration.rst](https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne/blob/master/gateone/applications/terminal/docs/configuration.rst)

Example to only allow `example@gmail.com` and `test@gmail.com` to access the SSH application:

 `/etc/gateone/conf.d/20authentication.conf` 

```
 // This is Gate One's Terminal application settings file.
{
    // "*" means "apply to all users" or "default"
    "*": {
       "terminal": { // These settings apply to the "terminal" application
            "commands": {
                "SSH": {"command": "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gateone/applications/terminal/plugins/ssh/scripts/ssh_connect.py -S '%SESSION_DIR%/%SESSION%/%SHORT_SOCKET%' --sshfp -a '-oUserKnownHostsFile=\\\"%USERDIR%/%USER%/
.ssh/known_hosts\\\"'", "description": "Connect to hosts via SSH."}
            },
            "default_command": "SSH",
            "dtach": true,
            "environment_vars": {"TERM": "xterm-256color"},
            "session_logging": true,
            "syslog_session_logging": false,
            "allow": false
        }
    },
    // "*" means "apply to all users" or "default"
    "user.upn=(example@gmail.com|test@gmail.com)": {
       "terminal": { // These settings apply to the "terminal" application
            "commands": {
                "SSH": {"command": "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gateone/applications/terminal/plugins/ssh/scripts/ssh_connect.py -S '%SESSION_DIR%/%SESSION%/%SHORT_SOCKET%' --sshfp -a '-oUserKnownHostsFile=\\\"%USERDIR%/%USER%/
.ssh/known_hosts\\\"'", "description": "Connect to hosts via SSH."}
            },
            "default_command": "SSH",
            "dtach": true,
            "environment_vars": {"TERM": "xterm-256color"},
            "session_logging": true,
            "syslog_session_logging": false,
            "allow": true
        }
    }
 }

```

### Reverse proxy

Using a reverse proxy to handle SSL and more than just Gate One on the same IP-address:443 listener is possible, but please note that Gate One uses WebSocket and that the reverse proxy must be able to handle WebSockets.

#### Nginx

Make sure that the port that the Gate One server is running on is blocked from outside by a firewall (like [iptables](/index.php/Iptables "Iptables")) or if you are running Gate One and nginx on the same server make sure it only listens on localhost. Please see [Nginx](/index.php/Nginx "Nginx") for more information about installing.

Edit your nginx configuration file similar to this:

**Note:** Listed below are only the server part of the nginx configuration

 `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` 

```
# HTTPS server
server {
	listen       [::]:443;
	listen       443;
	server_name  mysslhost;

	ssl                  on;
	ssl_certificate      server.crt;
	ssl_certificate_key  server.key;
	ssl_session_timeout  5m;
	ssl_protocols  SSLv2 SSLv3 TLSv1;
	ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
	ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;

    location /gateone/ {
		#auth_basic "Restricted";					#One extra layer of authentication
		#auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
		proxy_pass_header Server;
		proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
		proxy_redirect off;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
		proxy_pass http://localhost:8888;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
	}
	location /other {
		rewrite /other/(.*) /$1 break;
		include /etc/nginx/proxy.conf;
		proxy_pass http://10.1.1.200:80;
		break;
	}
}

```

**Note:** The above configuration requires the following Gate One configuration

 `/etc/gateone/conf.d/10server.conf` 

```
	"disable_ssl": true,
	"https_redirect": false,
	"port": 8888,
	"url_prefix": "/gateone/"

```

Gate One now lives under the URL: `https://your-nginx-server:443/gateone/`

## Systemd integration

Gate One package comes with a [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") service file: `gateone.service`.

## Problems

It has been reported that Gate One fails to open the terminal. This is because Gate One tries to execute `python`. If the executeable `python` isn't available it could fail, in that case please refer to [Python#Python 2](/index.php/Python#Python_2 "Python")
