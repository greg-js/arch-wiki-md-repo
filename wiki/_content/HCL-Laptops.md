Laptops and notebooks, because of their often unique hardware, have always provided challenges to any distribution of Linux. However, because laptops of the same model usually have identical hardware, a great help is to learn from somebody else's experience with that same model. Caveats are that some manufacturers use different hardware in the same model in different regions of the world.

The purpose of this page is to:

*   Help laptop owners use Arch Linux on their laptops to both Arch's and their laptop's full potential
*   Guide prospective buyers of laptops, regarding support for Arch Linux
*   Identify issues with Arch Linux that when fixed will over time make Arch Linux the best Linux for laptops

**If you have installed Arch Linux on a laptop, notebook (or other device), please share your experience here with the Arch community, for the benefit of all!**

**If you even consider contributing a new article specific to a new machine model, please consider the note in [Category:Laptops](/index.php/Category:Laptops "Category:Laptops") for guidance.**
