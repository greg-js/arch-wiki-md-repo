Joe's Own Editor or Joe is a text editor for Unix. It serves as a stand alone editor and has clones of [Vim](/index.php/Vim "Vim"), [Emacs](/index.php/Emacs "Emacs"), [Pico](/index.php/Nano "Nano") and WordStar. It has syntax highlighting for many common languages like Perl and C, and some for more uncommon languages like Haskell and Ada.

## Installing and Configuring

Joe can be installed with the [joe](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=joe) binary package or can be built from [source](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/joe-editor/joe-3.7.tar.gz?download). Extra syntax highlighting files can be found [here](https://github.com/cmur2/joe-syntax). Some are updated files and some are brand new ones like the Erlang syntax highlighting file.

Configuring is very straight forward, it's done through rc files, located in either /etc/joe/ or /usr/local/etc/joe depending on how you installed it. They can be edited there or copied to a home folder, for example /home/user/.joerc.
