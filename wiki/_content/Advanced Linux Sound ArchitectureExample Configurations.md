# Advanced Linux Sound Architecture/Example Configurations

From ArchWiki

Jump to: [navigation](#column-one), [search](#searchInput)

The following should serve as a guide for more advanced [ALSA](/index.php/ALSA "ALSA") setups. The configuration takes place in `/etc/asound.conf` as mentioned in the main article. None of the following configurations are guaranteed to work.

**Note:** Most things discussed here are much easier to accomplish using alsa plugins like upmix which are explained in the main article.

## Upmixing of stereo sources to 7.1 using dmix while saturated sources do not get upmixed

```
# 2008-11-15
#
# This .asoundrc will allow the following:
#
# - upmix stereo files to 7.1 speakers.
# - playback real 7.1 sounds, on 7.1 speakers,
# - allow the playback of both stereo (upmixed) and surround(7.1) sources at the same time.
# - use the 6th and 7th channel (side speakers) as a separate soundcard, i.e. for headphones
#   (This is called the "alternate" output throughout the file, device names prefixed with 'a')
# - play mono sources in stereo (like skype & ekiga) on the alterate output
#
# Make sure you have "8 Channels" and NOT "6 Channels" selected in alsamixer!
#
# Please try the following commands, to make sure everything is working as it should.
#
# To test stereo upmixÂ :      speaker-test -c2 -Ddefault -twav
# To test surround(5.1):      speaker-test -c6 -Dplug:dmix6 -twav
# To test surround(7.1):      speaker-test -c6 -Dplug:dmix8 -twav
# To test alternative output: speaker-test -c2 -Daduplex -twav
# To test mono upmix:         speaker-test -c1 -Dmonoduplex -twav
#
#
# It may not work out of the box for all cards. If it doesnt work for you, read the comments throughout the file.
# The basis of this file was written by wishie of #alsa, and then modified with info from various sources by 
# squisher. Svenstaro modified it for 7.1 output support.

## Surround51 incl. upmix stereo & dmix, swap L/R, bad speaker position in room

Bad practice but works fine for almost everything without additional per-program/file customization:

```
pcm.!default {
    type route
## forwards to the mixer pcm defined below
    slave.pcm dmix51
    slave.channels 6

## "Native Channels" stereo, swap left/right
    ttable.0.1 1
    ttable.1.0 1
## original normal left/right commented out
#    ttable.0.0 1
#    ttable.1.1 1

## route "native surround" so it still works but weaken signal (+ RL/RF swap) 
## because my rear speakers are more like random than really behind me
    ttable.2.3 0.7
    ttable.3.2 0.7
    ttable.4.4 0.7
    ttable.5.5 0.7

## stereo => quad speaker "upmix" for "rear" speakers + swap L/R
    ttable.0.3 1
    ttable.1.2 1

## stereo L+R => join to Center & Subwoofer 50%/50%
    ttable.0.4 0.5
    ttable.1.4 0.5
    ttable.0.5 0.5
    ttable.1.5 0.5
## to test: "$ speaker-test -c6 -twav" and: "$ speaker-test -c2 -twav"
}

pcm.dmix51 {
	type dmix
	ipc_key 1024
# let multiple users share
	ipc_key_add_uid false 
# IPC permissions (octal, default 0600)
# I think changing this fixed something - but I'm not sure what.
	ipc_perm 0660 # 
	slave {
## this is specific to my hda_intel. Often hd:0 is just allready it; To find: $ aplay -L 
		pcm surround51 
# this rate makes my soundcard crackle
#		rate 44100
# this rate stops flash in firefox from playing audio, but I do not need that
       rate 48000
       channels 6
## Any other values in the 4 lines below seem to make my soundcard crackle, too
       period_time 0
       period_size 1024
       buffer_time 0
       buffer_size 4096
	}
}
