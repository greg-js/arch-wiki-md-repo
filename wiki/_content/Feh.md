## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [feh](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=feh), which is available in the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

## Usage

feh is highly configurable. For a full list of options, run `feh --help`.

### As an image viewer

To quickly browse images in a specific directory, you can launch feh with the following arguments:

```
$ feh -g 640x480 -d -S filename /path/to/directory

```

*   The `-g` flag forces the images to appear no larger than 640x480
*   The `-d` flag draws the file name
*   The `-S filename` flag sorts the images by file name

This is just one example; there are many more options available should you desire more flexibility.

#### File Browser Image Launcher

The following script is useful for file browsers. It will display your selected image in feh, but it will enable you to browse all other images in the directory as well, in their default order, i.e. as if you had run "feh *" and cycled through to the selected image.

The script assumes the first argument is the filename.

 `feh_browser.sh` 

```
#!/bin/bash

shopt -s nullglob

if [[ ! -f $1 ]]; then
	echo "$0: first argument is not a file" >&2
	exit 1
fi

file=$(basename -- "$1")
dir=$(dirname -- "$1")
arr=()
shift

cd -- "$dir"

for i in *; do
	[[ -f $i ]] || continue
	arr+=("$i")
	[[ $i == $file ]] && c=$((${#arr[@]} - 1))
done

exec feh "$@" -- "${arr[@]:c}" "${arr[@]:0:c}"

```

Invoke the script with the selected image's path, followed by any additional arguments to feh. Here is an example of a launcher that you can use in a file browser:

 `$ /path/to/script/feh_browser.shÂ %f -F -Z` 

`-F` and `-Z` are feh arguments. `-F` opens the image in fullscreen mode, and `-Z` automatically zooms the image. Adding the `-q` flag (quiet) suppresses error messages to the terminal when feh tries loading non-image files from the current folder.

A simple but less versatile alternative is

 `feh_browser.sh` 

```
#! /bin/sh
feh -. "$(dirname "$1")" --start-at "$1"

```

This one does not seem to accept options.

### As a desktop wallpaper manager

**This article or section is out of date.**

**Reason:** GNOME Files doesn't manage the desktop anymore (that's handled by GNOME Shell) and Files doesn't use GConf anymore either. The GNOME info here wants revision or removal. (Discuss in [Talk:Feh#](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Talk:Feh))

feh can be used to manage the desktop wallpaper for window managers that lack desktop features, such as [Openbox](/index.php/Openbox "Openbox"), [Fluxbox](/index.php/Fluxbox "Fluxbox"), and [xmonad](/index.php/Xmonad "Xmonad").

When using [GNOME](/index.php/GNOME "GNOME"), you must prevent GNOME Files from controlling the desktop. The easiest way is to run this command:

 `$ gconftool-2 --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop --type boolean false` 

The following command is an example of how to set the initial background:

 `$ feh --bg-scale /path/to/image.file` 

Other scaling options include:

```
--bg-tile FILE
--bg-center FILE
--bg-max FILE
--bg-fill FILE

```

To restore the background on the next session, add the following to your startup file (e.g. `~/.xinitrc`, `~/.config/openbox/autostart`, etc.):

 `$ sh ~/.fehbg &` 

To change the background image, edit the file `~/.fehbg` which gets created after running the command `feh --bg-scale /path/to/image.file` mentioned above.

## Tips and tricks

### Open SVG images

 `$ feh --magick-timeout 1 file.svg` 

Note that you need imagemagick

### Random background image

You can have feh set a random wallpaper using the `--randomize` option with one of the `--bg-foo` options, for example:

 `$ feh --randomize --bg-fill ~/.wallpaper/*` 

The above command tells feh to randomize the list of files in the `~/.wallpaper/` directory and set the backgrounds for all available desktops to whichever images are at the front of the randomized list (one unique image for each desktop). You can also do this recursively, if you have your wallpapers divided into subfolders:

 `$ feh --recursive --randomize --bg-fill ~/.wallpaper` 

To set a different random wallpaper from `~/.wallpaper` each session, add the following to your `.xinitrc`:

 `$ feh --bg-max --randomize ~/.wallpaper/* &` 

Another way to set a random wallpaper on each x.org session is to edit your `.fehbg` as following.

 `$HOME/.fehbg` 

```
 feh --bg-max --randomize --no-fehbg ~/.wallpaper/* 

```

To change wallpapers periodically, use a script, cron job, or systemd service to execute the command at the desired interval.

#### Using a script

To rotate the wallpaper randomly, create a script with the code below (e.g. `wallpaper.sh`). Make the script executable:

 `$ chmod +x wallpaper.sh` 

and call it from `~/.xinitrc`. You can also put the source directly in `~/.xinitrc` instead of in a separate file.

Change the `~/.wallpaper` directory to fit your setup and the `15m` delay as you please (see `man sleep` for options).

 `wallpaper.sh` 

```
#!/bin/sh

while true; do
	find ~/.wallpaper -type f \( -name '*.jpg' -o -name '*.png' \) -print0 |
		shuf -n1 -z | xargs -0 feh --bg-max
	sleep 15m
done

```

You may have to change `find ~/.wallpaper` to `find ~/.wallpaper/` to make the above work.

This version does not fork as much, but this version does not recurse through directories:

 `wallpaper.sh` 

```
#!/bin/bash

shopt -s nullglob
cd ~/.wallpaper

while true; do
	files=()
	for i in *.jpg *.png; do
		[[ -f $i ]] && files+=("$i")
	done
	range=${#files[@]}

	((range)) && feh --bg-scale "${files[RANDOM % range]}"

	sleep 15m
done

```

##### For dual screen no-xinerama

This script replace the call to **feh** for add a wallpaper on systems with dual screen nvidia twinview (for example).

 `wallpaper.sh` 

```
#!/bin/sh
exec feh --bg-max --no-xinerama "$@"

```

#### Using a cron job

Using a [cron](/index.php/Cron "Cron") job, you can get a similar result, and it does not require having a script constantly sleeping.

Just do `$ crontab -e` and add:

```
* * * * *  DISPLAY=:0.0 feh --bg-max "$(find ~/.wallpaper/|shuf -n1)"

```

#### Using systemd user session

**Note:** This is useful **only** if you are using _systemd user session_. Read [Systemd/User](/index.php/Systemd/User "Systemd/User") for more details.

Create the unit service file:

 `$HOME/.config/systemd/user/feh-wallpaper.service` 

```
[Unit]
Description=Random wallpaper with feh

[Service]
Type=oneshot
EnvironmentFile=%h/.wallpaper
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/feh --bg-max "$(find ${WALLPATH}|shuf|head -n 1)"'

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

```

Now create the timer file. Change the time as necessary. In this example is `15 seconds`.

 `$HOME/.config/systemd/user/feh-wallpaper.timer` 

```
[Unit]
Description=Random wallpaper with feh

[Timer]
OnUnitActiveSec=_15s_
Unit=feh-wallpaper.service

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

```

In this example the configuration is one hidden file on the home directory with the path of the directory where the images are stored

 `$HOME/.wallpaper` 

```
WALLPATH=_/home/user/.wallpaper/_

```

Activate the `feh-wallpaper.timer` and `feh-wallpaper.service` daemons. Read [Daemons](/index.php/Daemons "Daemons") for more details.

**Note:** Remember that under _systemd user session_, you should use the `--user` flag on `systemctl`.
