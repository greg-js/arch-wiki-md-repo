## Introduction

Honeyd is an open source computer program that allows a user to set up and run multiple virtual hosts on a computer network. These virtual hosts can be configured to mimic several different types of servers, allowing the user to simulate an infinite number of computer network configurations. Honeyd is primarily used in the field of computer security by professionals and hobbyists alike.

This page goes over how to get a simple setup up and running. My server uses IP address 192.168.1.10\. My honeyd daemon will listen at 10.0.0.1.

## Installation

Install the [honeyd](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/honeyd/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> package from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

## Configuration

Create these files:

 `/root/default.conf` 

```
create host
set host default tcp action reset
add host tcp port 23 "/tmp/hello.sh"

bind 10.0.0.1 host

```

 `/tmp/hello.sh` 

```
#!/bin/sh
echo "Led Zeppelin, great band or greatest band?"
while read data
do
        echo "$data"
done

```

On your firewall, add the following route:

```
Destination IP 	Netmask 	Gateway
10.0.0.0	        255.0.0.0	192.168.1.10

```

Open up 2 shells on your server. In the first shell, start the honeyd program. In the second shell, use nc to connect to honeyd. The output should be as follows:

```
$ honeyd -d -p /usr/share/honeyd/nmap.prints -f default.conf 10.0.0.0/8

```

```

```
$ nc 10.0.0.1 23

There, you have a simple, basic, set up of honeyd. To kill honeyd, issue the command

```
killall honeyd

```
