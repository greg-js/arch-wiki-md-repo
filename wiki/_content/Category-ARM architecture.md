**Note:**

*   Support for the ARM architecture is provided by [Arch Linux ARM](http://archlinuxarm.org), which is a different project than [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org). Seek support on the [Arch Linux ARM forums](http://archlinuxarm.org/forum).
*   The ARM abbreviation also refers to [Arch Rollback Machine](/index.php/Arch_Rollback_Machine "Arch Rollback Machine"), which however provides packages for the Arch Linux official architectures `i686` and `x86_64`.

Arch Linux ARM is a port of Arch Linux to the [ARM architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture "wikipedia:ARM architecture").

As the Arch Linux ARM project does not maintain an official wiki, pages in this category provide some additional tips and tricks for various ARM devices. They are **not** intended as a replacement for the [official documentation](http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms).
