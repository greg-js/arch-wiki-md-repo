Arch Linux User Groups (ALUG) are local meet-ups of people using Arch Linux. They are similar to generic Linux User Groups, but specialize on Arch Linux.

The (probably) first ALUG is located in [DÃ¼sseldorf](http://wiki.chaosdorf.de/Arch_User_Group).

There is a ALUG in [Berlin](http://archlinux.berlin/) It's in a process of creation and will take place each first Wednesday of a Month. Join the IRC at #archlinux-berlin

The Arch Linux User Group Luxembourg (ALUGL) can officially be found at [ALUGL](https://wiki.c3l.lu/doku.php?id=events:alugl).
