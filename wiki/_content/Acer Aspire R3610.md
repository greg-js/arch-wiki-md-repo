# Configuration

## ALSA

The nVidia Corporation MCP79 High Definition Audio (uses codec Realtek ALC662 rev1) uses the snd_hda_intel kernel module which seems to work correctly with a 2 channel setup. If you have problems with multi-channel setup you can.

*   create /etc/modprobe.d/alsa.conf
*   In the file add the line

 `options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-6ch-dig ` 

Check /usr/src/linux-2.6.35-ARCH/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt for other models.

### Analogue 2channel audio ouput

This is the setup that alsa will use by default which appears to work correctly.

### S/PDIF audio output

To set this up do the following.

*   Make sure the output "S/PDIF" is unmuted in the alsamixer program (hint use arrow keys to select channel and press m and then ESC to exit)
*   Create a .asoundrc file in your home directory with following content.

```
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "dmix:0,1"
}

```

Note this has NOT been tested!

### HDMI audio output

To set this up do the following.

*   Use a video driver that supports HDMI output. At the time of writing only the proprietary NVidia driver supports this.
*   Make sure the output "S/PDIF 1" is unmuted in the alsamixer program (hint use arrow keys to select channel and press m and then ESC to exit)
*   Create a .asoundrc file in your home directory with following content.

```
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "dmix:0,3"
}

```

This has been tested and audio between applications can be multiplexed fine but you may get popping sounds when audio starts and stops. This happens even if the module parameter power saving is disabled, which is the default anyway.

## Graphics

### Proprietary driver

The nVidia Corporation ION VGA is part of the NV50 family. See [NVIDIA](/index.php/NVIDIA "NVIDIA") for details.

### Nouveau open source driver

At the time of writing the open source [nouveau driver](/index.php/Nouveau "Nouveau") is supported but HDMI audio output has not been implemented. See [http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FeatureMatrix](http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FeatureMatrix) for the current progress on the driver.
