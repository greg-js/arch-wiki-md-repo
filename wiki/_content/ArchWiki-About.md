## Goals

The primary objective of ArchWiki is to provide the [Arch Linux](/index.php/Arch_Linux "Arch Linux") user community with the most comprehensive and the most accessible documentation on the web. This is a world-wide project with many participants from all corners of the globe. The wiki embraces [The Arch Way](/index.php/The_Arch_Way "The Arch Way") with respect to _simplicity_. ArchWiki is constantly evolving and thrives on collaboration; there is always room for improvement.

### Comprehensive

One of the primary objectives of ArchWiki is to cover _all_ aspects of computing using Arch Linux. From the media center to managing corporate networks, anything Arch Linux can achieve is within the scope of ArchWiki.

### Accessible

The primary goal of ArchWiki may be grandiose, and thousands of articles are required; ArchWiki must offer a simple and intuitive way of accessing all the information. This is not a simple task, but typical Arch ingenuity and imagination will prevail.

The [official](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories") [arch-wiki-docs](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=arch-wiki-docs) package offers users the ability to download a copy of ArchWiki content. See [this](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=94201) forum discussion for details.

## How it works

ArchWiki is maintained by several [Administrators](/index.php/ArchWiki:Administrators "ArchWiki:Administrators"), [Maintainers](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintainers "ArchWiki:Maintainers") and [thousands of contributors](/index.php/Special:ListUsers "Special:ListUsers"). Users edit and organize articles to offer readers the best in Arch Linux documentation. The contents are created by the community, for the community: most articles are not written by a single person, but represent a cumulative effort of many people that correct erroneous information, update outdated articles, and otherwise keep improving the ArchWiki contents.

## How you can help

ArchWiki is maintained by volunteers. Maintainers are never too numerous, and help is always needed. If you feel capable of editing wiki pages, consider donating some of your time and energy to the community.

Please see [ArchWiki:Tasks](/index.php/ArchWiki:Tasks "ArchWiki:Tasks") to discover ways to contribute.
