From [Wikipedia:D (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language) "wikipedia:D (programming language)"):

"The D programming language, also known simply as D, is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language by Walter Bright of Digital Mars. It originated as a re-engineering of C++, but even though it is predominantly influenced by that language, it is not a variant of it. D has redesigned some C++ features and has been influenced by concepts used in other programming languages, such as Java, C#, and Eiffel".

## Installation

To program in D you will need two things - a D compiler and a library. Easiest way to get started fast is to install [dlang-dmd](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/dlang-dmd/) package group. It will provide the official compiler ([dmd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dmd)), standard lbrary [libphobos-devel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=libphobos-devel) and collection of small development tools [dtools](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dtools).

## Testing the installation

To make sure that everything is installed and set up correctly, a simple Hello World program should suffice.

```
import std.stdio;

void main() {
   string yourName = "archer";
   writefln("HelloÂ %s!", yourName);
}

```

Paste the code into a file, name it hello.d, and run

```
$ dmd hello.d

```

in the same directory as the file. You should then be able to execute the program with:

```
$ ./hello

```

You can also execute

```
$ dmd -run hello.d

```

which will simply compile and run without leaving any object files in the directory.

## Considerations

There are however possible choices regarding the compiler you choose. The standard (reference one) is dmd, but [gdc](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gdc) (GNU D Compiler) and [ldc](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=ldc) (LLVM D Compiler) are also popular. Those are also in [community].

The main difference is that the dmd's back end is not FOSS (licensed from Symantec), while the others compilers are completely FOSS. All 3 compilers share same front-end code and thus have almost identical support for language features (assuming same front-end version).

## Useful libraries and bindings
