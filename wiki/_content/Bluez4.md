## Installation

**Warning:** Bluez4 is unmaintained. It has been superseded by Bluez5\. Where possible, it is recommended that you use Bluez5 instead.

Bluez4 can be installed from the [bluez4](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bluez4/) package in the AUR. Ensure that the bluetooth daemon is started:

```
# systemctl start bluetooth

```

To enable the daemon at boot use the command:

```
# systemctl enable bluetooth

```

## Pairing with bluez4

The procedure on a mobile may be as follows:

*   The computer sends a connect request to the mobile.
*   A PIN, determined by the computer, is prompted for at the mobile
*   The same key must be re-entered at the computer.

To pair with a device without using the gnome-bluez package, the _bluez-simple-agent_ utility that comes with the bluez package can be used. This utility depends on three packages from the official repositories: [python2-dbus](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python2-dbus) [python2-gobject2](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python2-gobject2) [dbus-glib](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dbus-glib).

First, scan for external devices:

```
$ hcitool scan

```

Run the script as root:

```
# bluez-simple-agent

```

The message "Agent registered" should be returned, press `Ctrl+c` to quit.

Below is a basic example of pairing with a specific device. The script will ask for the passcode, enter the code and confirm with enter.

```
# bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:11:22:33:AA:BB

```

**Note:** bluez-simple-agent is only needed once for pairing a device, not every time you want to connect.

See the Examples section below for pairing examples with various devices.

## Bluez4 examples

### Siemens S55

**Note:** It has not yet been determined whether the connection can be initiated from the phone.

*   The steps under installation

 `$ hcitool scan` 

```
Scanning ...
        _XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX_  NAME

```

```
$ B=_XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX_

```

Start the simple-agent in a second terminal:

 `$ su -c bluez-simple-agent` 

```
Password: 
Agent registered

```

Back to the first console:

 `$ obexftp -b $B -l "Address book"` 

```
# Phone ask for pin, I enter it and answer yes when asked if I want to save the device
...
<file name="5F07.adr" size="78712" modified="20030101T001858" user-perm="WD" group-perm="" />

```

### Motorola V900

After installing [Blueman](/index.php/Blueman "Blueman") and running _blueman-applet_, click "find me" under _connections > bluetooth_ in Motorola device. In _blueman-applet_, scan devices, find the Motorola, click "add". Click "bond" in _blueman-applet_, enter some PIN, enter the same PIN in Motorola when it asks. In terminal:

```
$ mkdir ~/bluetooth-temp
$ obexfs -n _XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX_ ~/bluetooth-temp
$ cd ~/bluetooth-temp

```

and browse... Only audio, video, and pictures are available when you do this.

### Motorola RAZ

Install [obextool](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=obextool) [obexfs](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=obexfs) [obexftp](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=obexftp) [openobex](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=openobex) [bluez](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=bluez).

Edit your `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` and enter the proper class for your phone ( Class = 0x100100 ):

```
# Default device class. Only the major and minor device class bits are
# considered.
#Class = 0x000100
Class =  0x100100
```

 `# systemctl start bluetooth` 

```
:: Stopping bluetooth subsystem:  pand dund rfcomm hidd  bluetoothd
[DONE]
:: Starting bluetooth subsystem:  bluetoothd

```

Pairing with bluez-simple-agent only has to be done once. On your Motorola phone give 0000 in as your PIN when phone asks for it!

 `/usr/bin/bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:1A:1B:82:9B:6D` 

```
RequestPinCode (/org/bluez/10768/hci0/dev_00_1A_1B_82_9B_6D)
Enter PIN Code: 0000
Release
New device (/org/bluez/10768/hci0/dev_00_1A_1B_82_9B_6D)

```

Now you can browse the filesystem of your phone with obexftp:

 `obexftp -v -b 00:1A:1B:82:9B:6D -B 9 -l` 

```
Connecting..\done
Tried to connect for 448ms

```

Or you can mount your phone into a directory on your computer and treat it like a normal file system:

```
# groupadd bluetooth
# mkdir /mnt/bluetooth
# chown root:bluetooth /mnt/bluetooth
# chmod 775 /mnt/bluetooth
# usermod -a -G bluetooth arno
# obexfs -b 00:1A:1B:82:9B:6D /mnt/bluetooth/

```

### Pairing with an iPhone using bluez-simple-agent

Assuming a bluetooth device called hci0 and an iPhone that showed up in a hcitool scan as '00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF':

 `# bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF` 

```
Passcode:

```

### Logitech mouse MX Laser / M555b

To quickly test the connection:

```
$ hidd --connect _XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX_

```

For automated reconnection, use your desktop wizard to configure the bluetooth mouse. If your desktop environment doesn't includes support for this task, see the [Bluetooth mouse configuration](/index.php/Bluetooth_mouse_configuration "Bluetooth mouse configuration") article.

### Headset and ALSA devices

#### Referencing the bluetooth device in asound.conf

1\. Scan for your device:

```
$ hcitool (-i _optional hci#_***) scan

```

2\. Pair your headset with your device:

```
$ bluez-simple-agent (optional hci# ***) XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
  and put in your PIN (0000 or 1234, etc)

```

3\. Add this to your `/etc/asound.conf` file:

```
pcm.btheadset {
   type plug
   slave {
       pcm {
           type bluetooth
           device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
           profile "auto"
       }
   }
   hint {
       show on
       description "BT Headset"
   }
}
ctl.btheadset {
  type bluetooth
}

```

4\. Check to see if it has been added to ALSA devices

```
$ aplay -L

```

5\. Now play with _aplay_:

```
$ aplay -D btheadset _/path/to/audio/file_

```

or MPlayer:

```
$ mplayer -ao alsa:device=btheadset _/path/to/audio/or/video/file_

```

To find hci# for a usb dongle, type in:

```
$ hcitool dev

```

#### Using bluez-tools from the AUR

You can use [bluez-tools](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bluez-tools/) from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") with PulseAudio to stream audio to a bluetooth headset. Find the MAC of the headset:

```
$ hcitool scan

```

Connect to the headset:

```
$ bt-audio -c XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

```

Open pulseaudio volume control:

```
$ pavucontrol

```

The headset should show up in the Configuration tab.

### Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Keyboard 6000

1\. Scan for your device

 `$ hcitool (-i _optional_hci#_***) scan` 

```
Scanning ...
       00:11:22:33:44:55       Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Keyboard 6000

```

2\. On second console run as root (do not terminate):

 `# bluez-simple-agent` 

```
Agent registered

```

3\. Back on first console run:

 `$ bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:11:22:33:44:55` 

```
Enter PIN Code: 1234
(now enter that PIN on the keyboard and press enter)
Release
New device (/org/bluez/5373/hci0/dev_00_11_22_33_44_55)

```

4.

```
$ bluez-test-device trusted 00:11:22:33:44:55

```

5.

```
$ bluez-test-input connect 00:11:22:33:44:55

```

No your keyboard should work. You can terminate _bluez-simple-agent_ on second console with `Ctrl+C`

## Bluez4 - Troubleshooting

### passkey-agent

 `$ passkey-agent --default 1234` 

```
Can't register passkey agent
The name org.bluez was not provided by any .service files

```

and

```
$ hciconfig dev
# (no listing)

```

Try running `hciconfig hc0 up`

### Sennheiser MM400 headset connection problems

If your `Sennheiser MM400 Headset` immediately disconnects after connecting as `Headset Service` with Blueman, try to connect it as `Audio Sink`. Afterwards you can change the headset's `Audio Profile` to `Telephony Duplex` with a right click in Blueman. With this option headset functionality will be available although the headset was only connected as `Audio Sink` in first place and no disconnection will happen (tested with bluez 4.96-3, pulseaudio 1.1-1 and blueman 1.23-2).

### My device is paired but no sound is played from it

Try to first inspect `/var/log/messages.log`. If you see such messages:

```
Jan 12 20:08:58 localhost pulseaudio[1584]: [pulseaudio] module-bluetooth-device.c: Service not connected
Jan 12 20:08:58 localhost pulseaudio[1584]: [pulseaudio] module-bluetooth-device.c: Bluetooth audio service not available

```

try first:

```
# pactl load-module module-bluetooth-device
# pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover

```

or, if those modules cannot be found:

```
# pactl load-module module-bluez4-device
# pactl load-module module-bluez4-discover

```

If the module fails to work, do this workaround: Open `/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf` and add after **[General]** (on a new line)

```
Enable=Socket

```

Then restart the bluetooth daemon. Pair again your device, and you should find it in the pulseaudio settings (advanced settings for the sound)

[More information on Gentoo Wiki](http://wiki.gentoo.org/index.php?title=Bluetooth_Headset&redirect=no)

If after fixing this you still can't get sound, try using blueman (this is the only one that works for me), make sure that notify-osd is installed or it might show you weird error messages like this one: "Stream setup failed"

```
fail (/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/blueman/gui/manager/ManagerDeviceMenu.py:134)
fail (DBusException(dbus.String(u'Stream setup failed'),),)

```
