### Graphics

Works fine with [nvidia](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nvidia) from the [Official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

I haven't tested the nouvueau driver on this machine.

#### HDMI port

Video output works, but I couldn't get audio working over HDMI. If anyone has better luck, please post what you did.

### Keyboard Backlight

The keyboard backlight did not work out of the box. It is necessary to write scripts to get it working; take a look in /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight and it should be obvious what to do.

### Hibernate and Suspend

Works with some fixes [[1]](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=99238)

1\. Create the file /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom-ehci_hcd with the following contents

```
#!/bin/sh
# File: "/etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom-ehci_hcd".
TMPLIST=/tmp/ehci-dev-list

case "${1}" in
        hibernate|suspend)
    echo -n _ > $TMPLIST_
          for i in `ls /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci_hcd/ | egrep '[0-9a-z]+\:[0-9a-z]+\:.*$'`; do
              # Unbind ehci_hcd for first device XXXX:XX:XX.X:
               echo -n "$i" | tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci_hcd/unbind
           echo "$i" >> $TMPLIST
          done
        ;;
        resume|thaw)
    for i in `cat $TMPLIST`; do
              # Bind ehci_hcd for first device XXXX:XX:XX.X:
              echo -n "$i" | tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci_hcd/bind
    done
    rm $TMPLIST
        ;;
esac

```

and make it executable

```
#chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom-ehci_hcd

```

2\. Create the file /etc/pm/config.d/usb3-suspend-workaround with the following contents

```
#File: "/etc/pm/config.d/usb3-suspend-workaround".
SUSPEND_MODULES="xhci"

```

### Touchpad

Works fine with no configuration required, but works even better (3-finger) with [xf86-input-synaptics](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-synaptics) from the [Official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

### USB 3

The USB 3.0 port doesn't work at all under Windows or Arch, and I've been unable to determine why. I'm stuck with 3 USB 2.0 ports.

Note from another G73SW owner running Arch Linux: It works fine for me, has for over a year. I've a an early model G73SW with BIOS G73Sw.202\. My lspci is the same as above, but I have a few items that are one revision older, and an additional entry: 04:00.0 USB controller: Fresco Logic FL1000G USB 3.0 Host Controller (rev 04).

### DVD

Works fine with no configuration required.

### Sound

Works well both with pure ALSA and with PulseAudio. The two main speakers and the bass speaker can be controlled independently, which is sort of nifty. Jack detection in PulseAudio 2.0 didn't work so I disabled it, but I think that was Pulse's fault and not the hardware.

### Webcam

Works as well as in Windows, though that's not saying much. Except at very high light levels, the camera won't capture more than 3-5 frames per second. Cheese works fine out of the box.

### SD card reader

Works fine with no configuration required.

### Networking

#### LAN

Works fine with no configuration required.

#### WLAN

Works fine with no configuration required.

#### Bluetooth

Works fine with no configuration required.

### Untested
