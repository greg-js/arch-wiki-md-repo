**Note:** We are looking for somebody who can maintain this event - especially Slovak ATD.

Arch Translation Day is a day dedicated to translating the ArchWiki to other languages. The goal of this action is to connect arch-users and to translate as much pages as possible to our native languages. This allows those who do not speak English very well learn about Arch easier.

## When?

Arch Translation Day will take place on **the first Saturday of every month**.

## Who?

**Everyone** who wants to support our community somehow or wants to express his thanks for ArchLinux is invited.

## Why?

Are you asking why? Because we all use Arch and we like it. We use it on our desktops and servers. We have it near at hand almost all the time. This is the one way to offer our thanks that we can use it. We should definitely allow access to all pieces of information for whom the language is a barrier.

## How?

See instructions [here](/index.php/ArchWiki_Translation_Team#Create_a_new_page_and_its_translation "ArchWiki Translation Team") and visit [translation team page](/index.php/ArchWiki:Contributing#Translating "ArchWiki:Contributing") of your language.

## List of priority pages

Here you can find the list of pages whose translation is the most important. If you translate page, please remove it from the list.
