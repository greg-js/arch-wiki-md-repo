# Cgroups

**cgroups** (aka **control groups**) is a Linux kernel feature to limit, police and account the resource usage of certain processes (actually process groups). Compared to other approaches like the 'nice' command or `/etc/security/limits.conf`, cgroups are more flexible.

Control groups can be used in multiple ways:

*   create and manage them on the fly using tools like `cgcreate`, `cgexec`, `cgclassify` etc
*   the "rules engine daemon", to automatically move certain users/groups/commands to groups (`/etc/cgrules.conf` and `/usr/lib/systemd/system/cgconfig.service`)
*   through other software such as [Linux Containers](/index.php/Linux_Containers "Linux Containers") (LXC) virtualization

## Installing

First, install the utilities for managing cgroups; you need to install the [libcgroup](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libcgroup/) package from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") and [cgmanager](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=cgmanager).

If you wish to use the client script `cgm`, you will need to start the `cgmanager` daemon.

This can be done with a [systemd unit](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") like the following:

 `/usr/lib/systemd/system/cgmanager.service` 

```
[Unit]
Description=Control Group manager

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cgmanager

[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target

```

## Managing Resource Groups with Systemd

You can [enable](/index.php/Enable "Enable") the `cgconfig` service with systemd. This gives you the capability to track more easily any errors in `cgconfig.conf`.

## Simple usage

### Ad-hoc groups

One of the powers of cgroups is that you can create "ad-hoc" groups on the fly. You can even grant the privileges to create custom groups to regular users. `groupname` is the cgroup name:

```
# cgcreate -a _user_ -g memory,cpu:_groupname_

```

Now all the tunables in the group `groupname` are writable by your user:

```
$ ls -l /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/_groupname_
total 0
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cgroup.event_control
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cgroup.procs
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cpu.rt_period_us
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cpu.rt_runtime_us
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 cpu.shares
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 notify_on_release
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user root 0 Sep 25 00:39 tasks

```

Cgroups are hierarchical, so you can create as many subgroups as you like. If a normal user wants to run a `bash` shell under a new subgroup called `foo`:

```
$ cgcreate -g memory,cpu:**groupname/foo**
**cgexec**   -g memory,cpu:groupname/foo **bash**

```

To make sure:

```
$ cat /proc/self/cgroup
11:memory:/groupname/foo
6:cpu:/groupname/foo

```

A new subdirectory was created for this group. To limit the memory usage of all processes in this group to 10 MB, run the following:

```
$ echo 10000000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/groupname/foo/memory.limit_in_bytes

```

Note that the memory limit applies to RAM use only -- once tasks hit this limit, they will begin to swap. But it won't affect the performance of other processes significantly.

Similarly you can change the CPU priority ("shares") of this group. By default all groups have 1024 shares. A group with 100 shares will get a ~10% portion of the CPU time:

```
$ echo 100 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/groupname/foo/cpu.shares

```

You can find more tunables or statistics by listing the cgroup directory.

You can also change the cgroup of already running processes. To move all 'bash' commands to this group:

```
$ pidof bash
13244 13266
$ **cgclassify** -g memory,cpu:groupname/foo `pidof bash`
$ cat /proc/13244/cgroup
11:memory:/groupname/foo
6:cpu:/groupname/foo

```

### Persistent group configuration

**Note:** when using [Systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") > = 205 to manage cgroups, you can ignore this file entirely.

If you want your cgroups to be created at boot, you can define them in `/etc/cgconfig.conf` instead. For example, the "groupname" has a permission for `$USER` and _users_ of group `$GROUP` to manage limits and add tasks. A _subgroup_ "groupname/foo" group definitions would look like this:

 `/etc/cgconfig.conf ` 

```
group **groupname** {
  perm {
# who can manage limits
    admin {
      uid = **$USER**;
      gid = **$GROUP**;
    }
# who can add tasks to this group
    task {
      uid = **$USER**;
      gid = **$GROUP**;
    }
  }
# create this group in cpu and memory controllers
  cpu { }
  memory { }
}

group **groupname/foo** {
  cpu {
    **cpu.shares** = 100;
  }
  memory {
    **memory.limit_in_bytes** = 10000000;
  }
}
```

**Note:**

*   Comments should begin at the start of a line! The **#** character for comments must appear as the first character of a line. Else, _cgconfigparser_ will have problem parsing it but will only report `cgroup change of group failed` as the error, unless you started _cgconfig_ with [Systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd")
*   The permissions section is optional.
*   The `/sys/fs/cgroup/` hierarchy directory containing all _controllers_ sub-directories is already created and mounted at boot as a virtual file system. This gives the ability to create a new group entry with the `_$CONTROLLER-NAME { }_` command. If for any reason you want to create and mount hierachies in another place, you will then need to write a second entry in `/etc/cgconfig.conf` following this wayÂ :

```
 mount {    
   cpuset = /your/path/_groupname_;
}

```

This is equivalent to these shell commands:

```
 `# mkdir /your/path/_groupname_
# mount -t /your/path -o cpuset _groupname_ /your/path/_groupname_`

```

## Useful examples

### Matlab

Matlab does not have any protection against taking all your machine's memory or CPU. Launching a large calculation can thus trash your system. You could put the following in `/etc/cgconfig.conf` to protect from this (where `$USER` is your username):

 `/etc/cgconfig.conf ` 

```
# Prevent Matlab from taking all memory
group matlab {
    perm {
        admin {
            uid = _$USER_;
        }
        task {
            uid = _$USER_;
        }
    }

    cpuset {
        cpuset.mems="0";
        cpuset.cpus="0-5";
    }
    memory {
# 5 GiB limit
        memory.limit_in_bytes = 5368709120;
    }
}
```

**Note:** Do not forget to change $USER to the actual username Matlab will be run by.

This cgroup will bind Matlab to cores 0 to 5 (e.g., if you have have 8, Matlab will only see 6) and cap its memory usage to 5 GiB. The "cpu" resource constraint can also be defined to prevent CPU usage, but you may find the "cpuset" constrain to be sufficient.

Launch matlab like this:

```
$ cgexec -g memory,cpuset:matlab /opt/MATLAB/2012b/bin/matlab -desktop

```

Make sure to use the right path to the executable.
