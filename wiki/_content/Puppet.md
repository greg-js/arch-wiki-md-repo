## Installation

[puppet](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=puppet) is available in the official repositories.

If you want to install from Puppet's git repo, [puppet-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/puppet-git/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> is available through the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

## Configuration

Puppet's main configuration file is `puppet.conf` which is located at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`.

There are 3 sections to place settings depending if it is a master/agent: `[main]`, `[agent]` and `[master]`.

Bare minimum of settings are:

*   server: The hostname of the puppet server. Default: `puppet`
*   report: Most users should set this to true.
*   pluginsync: Most users should set this to true.
*   certname: The certified name of the machine (unique identifier). Default: `fqdn`

Puppet will look for node configuration in `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp`.

After starting puppet by daemon/cron/standalone, it will generate certificates in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/` directory. And you need to accept this certificaten the puppet master with: `sudo puppet cert sign <name>`.

## Facter

Facter is a companion program of puppet that gathers facts about the system it runs on.
commands:

```
# puppet facts find facter
# facter -p

```

**Note:** Facter is installed by default as a dependency of [puppet](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=puppet).

## Puppet Resources

### Packages

"Pacman" is supported by puppet. Installing packages works out of the box since puppet 3.1.0.

### Services

Since puppet 3.2.1 systemd on archlinux is fully supported.
The systemd provider in Puppet today only uses two commands for the service enable state:

```
 systemctl is-enabled <unit>, checking return code for the current enable state

 systemctl enable/disable <unit> to change it.

```

Otherwise service running will use:

```
 # systemctl start/stop/restart <unit>

```

Using the full unit name unit.service is supported.

## PuppetDB

PuppetDB is the fast, scalable, and reliable data warehouse for Puppet.
It caches data generated by Puppet, and gives you advanced features at awesome speed with a powerful API.
Puppetdb is in aur install [puppetdb](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/puppetdb/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> and [puppetdb-terminus](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/puppetdb-terminus/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup>
