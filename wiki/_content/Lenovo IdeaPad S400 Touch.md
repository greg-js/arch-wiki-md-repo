## Installation/Setup

When I first purchased the laptop it came preinstalled with Windows 8.1\. In order to begin the Arch Linux installation I had to, in Windows 8, enable booting into the BIOS via the Advanced Settings tab under Settings. Once in the BIOS I had to disable Secure Mode, enable USB boot, and enable Legacy Boot. From here I was able to install Arch without any problems. I chose to completely remove Windows 8.1, but should you want to preserve this OS please refer to the [Beginners' guide](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide "Beginners' guide") for more information.

### Wireless

Wireless works out of the box however it is recommended that you install the [broadcom wireless](/index.php/Broadcom_wireless "Broadcom wireless") drivers as I have found the wireless speed can become throttled without them.

## Post-Installation/Configuration

### Touch Screen

Works out of the box however gestures are not supported, the touch interface essentially just acts as another way to left-click.
