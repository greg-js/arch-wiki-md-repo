# Puppet Dashboard

**Note:** This wiki entry is a work-in-progress.

From the [Puppet Dashboard website](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/dashboard/):

	_The Puppet Dashboard is a web interface and reporting tool for your Puppet installation. Dashboard facilitates management and configuration tasks, provides a quick visual snapshot of important system information, and delivers valuable reports._

## Setting up a database for Puppet Dashboard

Setting up a database for Puppet Dashboard is the same as most other Ruby on Rails projects:

1.  Create a MySQL database.
2.  Create a MySQL user and grant privileges.
3.  Create a database.yml file that matches your database.
4.  Run db:migrate from within the Rails root.

You will need to decide on a database name and a Puppet Dashboard MySQL user and password. The user (and password) will never be used for authentication to the end-user. This guide assumes the database name puppet_dashboard with a username of puppet_dashboard and a random password, as described below.

### Create a MySQL database

First, make sure that a [MySQL](/index.php/MySQL "MySQL") server is installed and running. Log into MySQL as the root user, like so:

```
$ mysql -u root

```

Or, if you have set a root password:

```
$ mysql -u root -p

```

When logged in, create a database for Puppet Dashboard:

```
mysql> create database `puppet_dashboard` default charset utf8;

```

### Create a MySQL user and grant privileges

As mentioned, the MySQL user for Puppet Dashboard will never be available to the end-user, so it is a good idea to make a robust password. This is easily done by using pwgen (available in the mirrors as a part of the pwgen package). To get a randomly-generated, 50-character password, run it like this:

```
$ pwgen -N 1 -s 50
s5ODn3iaX97mv5Ky6VmW2Z4rBitX1JxWgFNAFQbdtTrcytM8vL

```

This will be the password used for the MySQL user. While at a MySQL prompt, run the following:

```
mysql> grant all on `puppet_dashboard`.* to 'puppet_dashboard'@'localhost' identified by 's5ODn3iaX97mv5Ky6VmW2Z4rBitX1JxWgFNAFQbdtTrcytM8vL';

```

Your database is now configured.

### Create a database.yml file that matches your database
