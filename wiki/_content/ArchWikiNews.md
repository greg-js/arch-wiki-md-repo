## 2015/10/02 - New maintainers

As a result of their long-term commitment and valuable contributions, [Det](/index.php/User:Det "User:Det"), [Kycok](/index.php/User:Kycok "User:Kycok"), [Neitsab](/index.php/User:Neitsab "User:Neitsab") and [Silverhammermba](/index.php/User:Silverhammermba "User:Silverhammermba") (in alphabetical order) have entered the official [ArchWiki:Maintenance Team](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team "ArchWiki:Maintenance Team"). Thank you for your help!

## 2015/07/08 - ArchWiki turns 10!

Exactly 10 years ago, on July 8th 2005, the ArchWiki was [installed](/index.php/ArchWiki:About#History "ArchWiki:About") with the MediaWiki engine: since then, more than [20,000](/index.php/Special:Statistics "Special:Statistics") users created their account and made almost 400,000 edits that evolved the initial blank page into this fantastic documentation resource that innumerable Arch and non-Arch Linux users every day browse from all around the world.

For the future, several major improvements are already under discussion or planning in various talk pages, with [Talk:Beginners' guide#Unification](/index.php/Talk:Beginners%27_guide#Unification "Talk:Beginners' guide"), [Help talk:I18n#Language namespace(s) in place of suffixes?](/index.php/Help_talk:I18n#Language_namespace.28s.29_in_place_of_suffixes.3F "Help talk:I18n"), [ArchWiki:Requests#Should we remove or archive obsolete articles?](/index.php/ArchWiki:Requests#Should_we_remove_or_archive_obsolete_articles.3F "ArchWiki:Requests") or [ArchWiki talk:Maintenance Team#Reorganization](/index.php/ArchWiki_talk:Maintenance_Team#Reorganization "ArchWiki talk:Maintenance Team") being only some notable examples. For this anniversary, [ArchWiki:Statistics](/index.php/ArchWiki:Statistics "ArchWiki:Statistics") has been expanded, and many more ideas have been brought up in its talk page to better show the evolution of the wiki and try to give something back to the most active contributors.

If you did not make it to get involved in the community of contributors in the past decade, you are very welcome to become one of the first ones of the decade that has just started! The wiki syntax is very easy to learn and use, you can find an introduction in [Help:Editing](/index.php/Help:Editing "Help:Editing"), and [ArchWiki:Contributing](/index.php/ArchWiki:Contributing "ArchWiki:Contributing") is there to give you plenty of inspiration about how and where to start. If you have any questions, just ask in the talk page of one of those pages, or any other that suits your specific issue, and the wiki staff, or possibly other proactive users, will try their best to give you a quick and accurate answer.

Well, Happy Birthday ArchWiki, then! The celebrations will go on until the weekend, as for example the 11th is the anniversary of the first edit: if you want, you can take this chance to make a small gift edit to your favorite article ;) Let's keep working together to make this project grow better and better for the next 10 years and more, thanks everybody!

## 2015/05/24 - Restyled AUR template

[Template:AUR](/index.php/Template:AUR "Template:AUR") has been restyled with the addition of an "AUR" superscript to make AUR packages look different from official ones: this has the consequence that almost all articles mentioning AUR packages now have a redundant "from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR")" wording that needs to be removed. In the same fashion, the "from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories")" wording associated to official packages is deprecated.

Describing how to install a package is still forbidden by [Help:Style#Package management instructions](/index.php/Help:Style#Package_management_instructions "Help:Style") but, for both official and AUR packages, you can use the "install" word as a link, e.g. `[[Install]]`, to point users to the [centralized package installation instructions](/index.php/Install "Install").

This change was discussed and voted in [Help talk:Style#Pkg and AUR templates: add icon, make them look different](/index.php/Help_talk:Style#Pkg_and_AUR_templates:_add_icon.2C_make_them_look_different "Help talk:Style").

## 2015/04/24 - New administrator

Congratulations to [Alad](/index.php/User:Alad "User:Alad") on his promotion to [Administrator](/index.php/ArchWiki:Administrators "ArchWiki:Administrators"), naturally following his long streak of exemplary contributions to the articles and proactive, all-round participation in the organization of the wiki, which will now be able to benefit even more greatly from the experience he gained while serving as an official Maintainer.

## 2015/04/19 - New maintainer

Today the [ArchWiki:Maintenance Team](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team "ArchWiki:Maintenance Team") gains the help of [Chazza](/index.php/User:Chazza "User:Chazza"), who distinguished himself for the quality of his work in the wiki, thank you!

— [Kynikos](/index.php/User:Kynikos "User:Kynikos") ([talk](/index.php/User_talk:Kynikos "User talk:Kynikos")) 03:28, 19 April 2015 (UTC)

## 2014/12/22 - Adopt an article

The ingredients of a healthy and successful wiki are both the addition of fresh, up-to-date content (the "attack"), but also protection from counter-productive edits (the "defense"). While "attacking" may be the most entertaining part, please be aware that helping "defend" the ArchWiki is of invaluable importance and fortunately also extremely easy! Just add a bunch of your favorite articles to your _watchlist_ and follow their changes, taking action when necessary: the wiki will receive your love with gratitude :) See [ArchWiki:Contributing#The most important task](/index.php/ArchWiki:Contributing#The_most_important_task "ArchWiki:Contributing") for a more extensive introduction.

## 2014/10/31 - Unintelligible edits

This news entry is a reminder that edits that do not respect [the 3 fundamental contributing rules](/index.php/ArchWiki:Contributing#The_3_fundamental_rules "ArchWiki:Contributing") may be reverted without previous warning, especially on popular articles. The ArchWiki is a _shared_ resource within the Arch community, and users who do not understand this concept, and treat wiki articles like they would with their own personal blog, are invited to spend their time somewhere else. Thank you for choosing to respect your fellow Archers, keep up the good work everybody!

## 2014/08/03 - New administrator

With great pleasure we announce that [Lahwaacz](/index.php/User:Lahwaacz "User:Lahwaacz") has gained his seat at the [command table](/index.php/ArchWiki:Administrators "ArchWiki:Administrators"), very well deserved after tirelessly serving our community with more than a year of innumerable, high-quality contributions that have certainly played a big part in the continuous effort we all make to preserve the ArchWiki as one of the best Linux documentation sources currently available. Congratulations!

Thank you for the effort you are spending on the wiki!

## 2014/03/13 - New maintainer

We are happy to announce that [Lonaowna](/index.php/User:Lonaowna "User:Lonaowna") has joined forces with the other members of the [ArchWiki:Maintenance Team](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team "ArchWiki:Maintenance Team"). Keep up the good work!

## 2013/12/09 - Code templates are fixed

[Template:bc](/index.php/Template:Bc "Template:Bc") and [Template:hc](/index.php/Template:Hc "Template:Hc") have been adapted to work like before they [broke](#2013.2F12.2F08_-_MediaWiki_1.22.0_has_broken_code_templates). No fixes are required anymore.

— [Kynikos](/index.php/User:Kynikos "User:Kynikos") ([talk](/index.php/User_talk:Kynikos "User talk:Kynikos")) 05:15, 9 December 2013 (UTC)

## 2013/12/08 - MediaWiki 1.22.0 has broken code templates

After [upgrading](https://projects.archlinux.org/vhosts/wiki.archlinux.org.git/commit/?id=4ac9fa081a7c045f6a9f1cfc529d82423f485b2e) MediaWiki to version 1.22.0, the wiki will not parse wiki syntax or HTML code inside [Template:bc](/index.php/Template:Bc "Template:Bc") and [Template:hc](/index.php/Template:Hc "Template:Hc") anymore, rendering them as plain text. This has broken many templates around, especially those that were using `''` and `'''` for highlighting parts of code with italic or bold. Please help fixing them, guidelines for dealing with the various cases are a work in progress.

## 2013/08/05 - New maintainer

A new user, [Lahwaacz](/index.php/User:Lahwaacz "User:Lahwaacz"), has joined the [official Maintenance Team](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team "ArchWiki:Maintenance Team"): our community is thankful for the quality and accuracy of his contributions.

## 2013/06/15 - New maintainer

The [official Maintenance Team](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team "ArchWiki:Maintenance Team") sees the addition of a new member: thank you [Flu](/index.php/User:Flu "User:Flu"), your commitment will be of great help for our wiki.

## 2013/05/02 - New administrator

The ArchWiki proudly welcomes a new administrator, [Fengchao](/index.php/User:Fengchao "User:Fengchao"), whose passionate dedication to our community we have been able to witness over the past several months: thank you! We are confident this will give our beloved, ever-growing wiki an important help in maintenance and moderation for the times to come.

— [Kynikos](/index.php/User:Kynikos "User:Kynikos") ([talk](/index.php/User_talk:Kynikos "User talk:Kynikos")) 11:01, 2 May 2013 (UTC)

## 2012/06/11 - Changes in internationalization

In the next few days [Template:i18n](/index.php/Template:I18n "Template:I18n") will be deprecated and replaced by interlanguage links (e.g. `[[en:Title]]`) also for the languages hosted locally. This operation will be completely performed by a [bot](/index.php/User:Kynikos.bot "User:Kynikos.bot"), please do not attempt to "help" it with manual edits, as it is necessary to follow a particular procedure and you would risk compromising its operations. The original discussion is in [Help talk:I18n#"Dummy" interlanguage links and deprecation of Template:i18n](/index.php/Help_talk:I18n#.22Dummy.22_interlanguage_links_and_deprecation_of_Template:i18n "Help talk:I18n").

## 2012/06/06 - Maintenance team additions

We announce that also [Filam](/index.php/User:Filam "User:Filam"), [Emiralle](/index.php/User:Emiralle "User:Emiralle") and [jstjohn](/index.php/User:Jstjohn "User:Jstjohn") have joined the group of [Maintainers](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintainers "ArchWiki:Maintainers"): the ArchWiki is thankful for their contributions so far!

## 2012/05/20 - Maintenance team

An official team of users has been created with the purpose of helping supervising the [recent changes](/index.php/Special:RecentChanges "Special:RecentChanges") and fixing the resulting [reports](/index.php/ArchWiki:Reports "ArchWiki:Reports"). See [ArchWiki:Maintenance Team](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team "ArchWiki:Maintenance Team") for more information. Thanks to the initial [Maintainers](/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintainers "ArchWiki:Maintainers") (in alphabetical order) [AlexanderR](/index.php/User:AlexanderR "User:AlexanderR"), [Fengchao](/index.php/User:Fengchao "User:Fengchao"), [Graysky](/index.php/User:Graysky "User:Graysky") and [Skydiver](/index.php/User:Skydiver "User:Skydiver"), who have been chosen for their constant commitment and the accuracy and quality of their work on the ArchWiki.

## 2011/11/01 - Official style guidelines

An official set of style rules is now defined in [Help:Style](/index.php/Help:Style "Help:Style") in order to improve the consistency of content formatting among the various articles: all ArchWiki contributors are encouraged to read these guidelines and follow them when editing articles.

— [Kynikos](/index.php/User:Kynikos "User:Kynikos") 12:14, 1 November 2011 (EDT)

## 2011/09/20 - Administration team additions

Congratulations to the two newest additions to the [ArchWiki administration team](/index.php/ArchWiki:Administrators "ArchWiki:Administrators"): [Kynikos](/index.php/User:Kynikos "User:Kynikos") and [thestinger](/index.php/User:Thestinger "User:Thestinger"). Over the past year, both have demonstrated dedication and exceptional judgment in maintaining and improving ArchWiki. Their contributions have undoubtedly helped thousands of (Arch and non-Arch) Linux users and served to render ArchWiki one of the best sources of GNU/Linux documentation on the web. Thank you!

— [pointone](/index.php/User:Pointone "User:Pointone") 15:37, 20 September 2011 (EDT)

## 2011/05/29 - A reminder

Please completely avoid the use of [contractions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_(grammar)) and keep the language formal. Thanks!

— [Misfit138](/index.php/User:Misfit138 "User:Misfit138") 19:38, 29 May 2011 (EDT)

## 2010/03/27 - Thank you, ArchWiki contributors

Thanks to everyone for their invaluable contributions to ArchWiki. Its content and reputation have been and continue to be second to none. Please keep the knowledge flowing in.

— [Misfit138](/index.php/User:Misfit138 "User:Misfit138") 12:37, 27 March 2010 (EDT)

## 2010/01/14 - Internationalization guidelines

As you may have noticed, many articles have been moving around this past month; especially non-English ones. This was due to a recent discussion on the topic of ArchWiki internationalization. As a result, new guidelines have been drafted and a major transition has begun.

For more detail, please see the related [forum thread](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=87189) and [Help:i18n](/index.php/Help:I18n "Help:I18n"). Briefly, the following standards have been set:

*   Non-English article titles should be of the form **Title in English (Language)**, where "Language" is the localized spelling of the language.
*   Localized titles can and should still be created, but only as redirects to the English-named article.
*   [Template:i18n](/index.php/Template:I18n "Template:I18n") should be used in place of the old `Template:i18n links start`, `Template:i18n entry`, and `Template:i18n links end` combination.

We hope this does not alienate or inconvenience international users; these changes were made primarily to facilitate wiki maintenance and administration and to simplify inter-language linking. Thanks for all your translations and other contributions thus far, and please continue making ArchWiki the envy of distributions world-wide!

— [pointone](/index.php/User:Pointone "User:Pointone") 23:43, 14 January 2010 (EST)

## 2009/09/18 - Remember to keep it formal

Please remember to avoid chatty, conversational style throughout the wiki. Also, avoid signing your name to a wiki article or comment therein. Thanks!

— [Misfit138](/index.php/User:Misfit138 "User:Misfit138") 11:36, 18 September 2009 (EDT)

## 2009/01/04 - Article categories!

Please remember to add your contributed articles to the appropriate category at the top of the page. This will streamline the search process and make use of the [Table of contents](/index.php/Table_of_contents "Table of contents") system in place. Thanks!

— [Misfit138](/index.php/User:Misfit138 "User:Misfit138") 12:33, 4 January 2009 (EST)

## 2008/09/21 - The finest GNU/Linux distribution wiki

Thanks to your vigilant dedication and contribution, the Arch Linux wiki remains the finest available. It continues to grow and improve in quality daily. Nothing negative to report, just keep up the great work.

— [Misfit138](/index.php/User:Misfit138 "User:Misfit138") 12:55, 21 September 2008 (EDT)

## 2008/07/22 - Thank you, Arch users

The recent boost in wiki contribution has been nothing short of miraculous. Thanks to everyone contributing and improving ArchWiki. Informative and well written articles, as well as gratuitous translations, are coming in at an alarming rate. Because of you, word is spreading about Arch Linux, its high quality wiki and its excellent community!

— [Misfit138](/index.php/User:Misfit138 "User:Misfit138") 20:28, 22 July 2008 (EDT)

## 2008/05/01 - Don't just give me the 'how' - give me the 'why'

A wiki is a collection of knowledge, most of which ends up being how-tos, which is to be expected. Let us always remember to add the 'why' to our how-tos. Explanatory information always goes further toward imparting knowledge than does instruction alone. Adding explanatory wiki articles is also welcome. Why not add one if you are qualified?

Thanks for the recent increase in contribution to the wiki! Please keep the knowledge coming.

— [Misfit138](/index.php/User:Misfit138 "User:Misfit138") 12:45, 1 May 2008 (EDT)

## 2008/04/21 - ArchWiki needs YOU!

In our goal to provide the most exhaustive high-quality documentation, Arch is calling all qualified users to contribute to the wiki. Share your knowledge and help us improve this invaluable free resource.
