# One Time PassWord

**One Time PassWord** (**OTPW**) is a PAM module allowing single-use passwords to login to a system. This is especially useful in the context of Secure Shell, allowing a user to login from a public or shared computer using a single-use password which will never work again.

Instructions for installing OTPW and configuring SSH to allow OTPW logins are below.

## Installation

Install the [otpw](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/otpw/) package from the AUR.

## Configuration for SSH Logins

### PAM Configuration

Create a PAM configuration file for otpw:

 `/etc/pam.d/ssh-otpw` 

```
auth sufficient pam_otpw.so
session optional pam_otpw.so

```

Next, modify sshd's PAM configuration to include otpw. If you are disabling static password auth, comment out the 2nd bold line. Here is the modified `/etc/pam.d/sshd` for reference:

 `/etc/pam.d/sshd` 

```
#%PAM-1.0
#auth     required  pam_securetty.so     #disable remote root

**auth      include   ssh-otpw**
**#auth      include   system-remote-login #NOTE: This must be disabled to completely disable password logins.**
account   include   system-remote-login
password  include   system-remote-login
session   include   system-remote-login

```

### sshd Configuration

OTPW uses Keyboard-Interactive logins for SSH sessions, which are enabled by adding these lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
UsePAM yes
UsePrivilegeSeparation yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

```

**Note:** Make sure not to add redundant or conflicting configuration lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`! For instance, make sure there are not two UsePAM lines, etc.

If you wish to allow static password logins as well, ensure `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` contains a line like this:

```
PasswordAuthentication yes

```

Otherwise, set it to **no**. See the above info on editing `/etc/pam.d/sshd` to fully disable static password auth, as PAM will otherwise allow a static password if OTPW fails (e.g. when a user runs out of passwords).

If you allow password authentication, then after failing one authentication method, ssh clients will fall back to the other. Note that by default, ssh allows you three attempts at a password per login method.

### OTPW Configuration

OTPW is configured independently for each user account. If a given account does not have OTPW configured, that account will simply use a static password as usual. To configure OTPW for an account, run as that user:

```
$ otpw-gen > ~/otpw_passwords

```

`otpw-gen` will ask for a password prefix, which must be typed at the beginning of all otpw passwords. This is to ensure that if someone else gets your OTPW list, they can't use it to login to your account without knowing your prefix.

After running the above command, there should be a file in the user's home directory called `otpw_passwords` which contains all of the user's OTPW passwords. There will also be a file `~/.otpw` which contains the password hashes. `otpw_passwords` can be printed and referenced when logging in.

## Usage

After completing the configuration above, ssh should use OTPW automatically for users who have it configured. An OTPW login prompt looks like so:

```
Password 041: 

```

To log in, simply look up password 41 in your `otpw_passwords` list, for example:

```
041 lYr0 g7QR

```

And type in your prefix followed by both halves of the password. The space is provided for readability and may or may not be included in the typed password. Do not enter a space between the prefix and the single-use password.

To specify to the ssh client which login method you would like to use, add `-o PreferredAuthentication=keyboard-interactive` to use OTPW, or `-o PreferredAuthentication=password` for static passwords. These options can also be specified in `~/.ssh/config` per-server.

To prevent someone from shoulder-surfing your OTPW and quickly using it to login to your account before you login, OTPW requires a concurrent login to enter three passwords instead of just one. This will usually not be an issue, but if OTPW should give a prompt like this:

```
Password 072/251/152: 

```

Then simply enter your prefix, and the three requested passwords in the order they are requested in. When a login is initiated, OTPW creates a file `~/.otpw.lock` to detect concurrent logins. If a second login is initiated when this file exists, OTPW will request the three passwords.

**Note:** Due to a [bug](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=632) in the way OpenSSH calls PAM, the `~/.otpw.lock` file will not be deleted if the user cancels an SSH login using Ctrl-C or the like, and OTPW will always ask for triple passwords after this. The bug is marked as fixed, but it still affects me. As a workaround, one may simply delete the lock file manually, and OTPW will resume normal single-password requests.
