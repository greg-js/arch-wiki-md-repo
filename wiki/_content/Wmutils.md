# Wmutils

Using [wmutils](https://github.com/wmutils) (_window manipulation utilities_), you can do a multitude of simple tasks such as listing windows, moving/resizing/teleporting them, changing their visibilty, changing their stacking order, and more. You can even chain commands together to complete actions that other window managers cannot do.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [wmutils-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wmutils-git/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> package for the core functionality. For optional addons, use this [PKGBUILD](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/0aae159561780f0eeec7/raw) instead.

_wmutils_, however, is only a windows manipulation utility. A [window manager](/index.php/Window_manager "Window manager") and a keybinding controller ([sxhkd](/index.php/Sxhkd "Sxhkd"), [xbindkeys](/index.php/Xbindkeys "Xbindkeys") and others) are also required. In the following sections, [swm-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/swm-git/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup> and _sxhkd_ will be used.
