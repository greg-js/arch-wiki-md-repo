We aim for minimal hardware requirements, as low as a Pentium I processor and 64 MB RAM for a graphical desktop. We decided to base ConnochaetOS on Arch Linux, but completely rebuild, since we want to support i586, and replace some packages with our own ones, because of footprint, stability or freedom.

### UKnow4Kids

The UKnow4Kids Live DVD is a Linux distribution compiling educational software for children 2- to 10-years-old. The distribution is intended for broad usage by a non-technical audience (regular parents). Development stalled in mid 2010.

*   Uses Arch Linux as the core, LXDE/OpenBox as the window manager, SLiM as the display manager, and mastered using gradgrind's Larch scripts.
*   It is essentially indestructible for children's use, and it is impossible for the hard drive of the host PC to be affected when the live CD is running.
*   Runs well on old Intel hardware, so it should run fine on a Pentium II with 256 MB RAM (that's what my kid uses) or better.
*   Provides a familiar Windows-like/Mac-like user experience, requiring only minimal computer experience to run.

### archlive-i586

Arch Linux is an i686 optimized distribution, but sometimes members of the community ask how to install it on VIA C3 (mini-itx systems) or AMD Geode based systems. Since these CPUs are not fully i686 compatible, there is the need for an i586 port. There have been some past attempts to create an i586 port of Arch Linux. Some were successful, but they are not maintained anymore. The goal of archlive-i586 is to have an up to date i586 installation CD, with a reasonably sized package repository with at least 4-5 mirrors.

*   Homepage: [http://code.google.com/p/archlinux-i586/](http://code.google.com/p/archlinux-i586/)

### Firefly Linux

Firefly Linux is a lightweight operating system designed with netbooks in mind. Firefly Linux Float, the main edition of Firefly, comes with the small and fast LXDE desktop environment. It also includes many popular applications to help the user get the most out of a netbook. Firefly Linux is powerful and is not limited to a "netbook-oriented" interface. Being relatively lightweight, Firefly can also be used for low-end systems.

### Maryan Linux 2

The Maryan Linux 2 Project is designed to enable older hardware to run a fast and beautiful dekstop. For this reason, Maryan uses Enlightenment 17, which is a lightweight and very visually appealing desktop environment. The Maryan Linux developers strongly believe that this desktop environment is mature, stable (most of the time), and one of the most efficient for minimal computer resources usage.
