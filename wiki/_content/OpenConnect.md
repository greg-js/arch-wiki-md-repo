## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [openconnect](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=openconnect) package.

## Usage

OpenConnect can be used with NetworkManager, or manually via the command line.

### NetworkManager

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [networkmanager-openconnect](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=networkmanager-openconnect) package. Then configure and connect with `nm-applet` (network manager's tray icon) or similar utility. After installation, [restart](/index.php/Restart "Restart") the `NetworkManager.service`.

See [NetworkManager](/index.php/NetworkManager "NetworkManager") for details.

### Command Line

Simply run openconnect as root and enter your username and password when prompted:

```
# openconnect _vpnserver_

```

More advanced invocation with username and password:

```
# echo -n _password_ | openconnect -u _user_ --passwd-on-stdin _vpnserver_

```

### Integration in netctl

A simple <tt>tuntap</tt> netctl.profile(5) can be used to integrate OpenConnect in the normal [Netctl](/index.php/Netctl "Netctl") workflow.

```
Description='VPN'
Interface=vpn
Connection=tuntap
Mode=tun
#User=root
#Group=root

BindsToInterfaces=(enp0s25 wlp2s0)
IP=no

PIDFILE=/run/openconnect_${Interface}.pid
SERVER=vpn.example.net
AUTHGROUP="VPN"                                     # might be asked by openconnect before asking for password
USERNAME=user 
PASSWORD=`su ${USERNAME} -c "pass vpn/${USERNAME}"` # assuming the user uses pass(1) to keep their passwords safe

ExecUpPost="echo ${PASSWORD} | /usr/bin/openconnect --background --pid-file=${PIDFILE} --interface=${Interface} --authgroup='${AUTHGROUP}' --user=${USERNAME} --passwd-on-stdin ${SERVER}"
ExecDownPre="kill -INT $(cat ${PIDFILE})Â ; ip link delete ${Interface}"

```

Saved as, e.g., <tt>/etc/netctl/vpn</tt>, this allows such manipulations as

```
$ netctl start vpn
$ netctl restart vpn
$ netctl stop vpn

```
