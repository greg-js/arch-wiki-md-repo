## Issues

### ACPI and Intel KMS

Screen goes black when [Intel KMS](/index.php/Intel#KMS_.28Kernel_Mode_Setting.29 "Intel") and ACPI is on. Brightness controls are not working.

**Solution**: Add the following to your kernel parameter list:

```
 acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor

```

**Alternate solution** (as those parameters break some fn keys):

*   With `acpi_osi=Linux` or both - mute, wireless and sleep keys do not work.
*   With `acpi_backlight=vendor`, brightness is not shifted, but control is totally disabled and brightness does not restore to max when AC power is restored.

So instead (as seen [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/631323/comments/2)):

```
# setpci -s 00:02.0 f4.b=ff

```

Where "00:02.0" is PCI address of video card (as reported by `lspci`). This shifts up min and max brightness levels on hardware level, without affecting anything in `/sys/class/backlight/...` or `/proc/acpi/video/VGA/LCDD/...`

Using `acpi_backlight=vendor` and changing `f4.b` register simultaneously will result in **even brighter**, blinding maximum backlight, while used separately the effect is roughly equal.

### LCD Brightness

See [Backlight](/index.php/Backlight "Backlight").

If brightness levels are erratic, download the latest BIOS from [Asus](http://support.asus.com)

If maximum brightness seems lower than it should be, see setpci solution above.

### Network Adapter

**Problem**: The network adapter for wired LAN does not or rarely get recognized (`lspci` and `ip addr` do not list it).

**Solution**: Add the following to your kernel parameter list:

```
 eeepc_laptop.hotplug_disabled=1

```

### Touchpad

See [Touchpad Synaptics](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics "Touchpad Synaptics").

Two-Finger scrolling works with a `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` like this:
