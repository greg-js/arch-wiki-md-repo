## Introduction

This article tries to address the problem of video tearing on the TV via Nvidia video card. The scenario typically involves the VGA (D-sub or DVI) connection to the monitor (LCD or CRT) with the S-Video handling the TV output.

This approach has been confirmed to work with Geforce 5900XT, Geforce 7300GT, and Geforce 7600GS. (All three have onboard TV-encoders on the GPU.)

## Possible Issues

Be aware that you may run into possible issues with Beryl 0.20, if the wrong **Option** in **xorg.conf** is used. (You will encounter unusual graphical issues).

There is a known issue with HD mode of Nvidia cards and PAL standard. As in it doesn't work!Â :(

## Step 1: Clone desktop to TV (CRT).

In this example we have connected the TV-OUT of the video card to the S-Video IN of our TV (CRT solution). The driver version we're using is **1.0-9755** with Xorg **7.2**. Typically, you can let the Nvidia driver handle detecting TV-Out (S-Video). However, there are times where the driver will not detect things correctly, and you may have to manually override it via **xorg.conf**, (by specifically setting the values). **CRT-0** is the computer monitor, and **TV-0** is obviously the TV.

NOTE: **PAL-B** is seen below as this is the standard for Australian TVs. (See **[1]** in the **REFERENCES** section for other regions around the world).

Use **nano** or **vim** to open **/etc/X11/xorg.conf** file, scroll down until you find the **"Device"** section.

It will be something like:

```
Section "Device"
    Identifier   "Card0"
    Driver       "nvidia"
    VendorName   "ALL"
    BoardName    "ALL"
EndSection

```

Add the following:

```
    Option "TwinView"
    Option "TwinViewOrientation" "Clone"
    Option "MetaModes"           "CRT-0: 1024x768,  TV-0: 1024x768"
    Option "HorizSync"           "CRT-0: 30-81;  TV-0: 30-50"
    Option "VertRefresh"         "CRT-0: 56-76;  TV-0: 60"
    Option "ConnectedMonitor"    "CRT-0, TV-0"
    Option "TVStandard"          "PAL-B"
    Option "TVOutFormat"         "SVIDEO" 

```

So it becomes:

```
Section "Device"
    Identifier   "Card0"
    Driver       "nvidia"
    VendorName   "ALL"
    BoardName    "ALL"
    Option       "TwinView"
    Option       "TwinViewOrientation" "Clone"
    Option       "MetaModes"           "CRT-0: 1024x768,  TV-0: 1024x768"
    Option       "HorizSync"           "CRT-0: 30-81;  TV-0: 30-50"
    Option       "VertRefresh"         "CRT-0: 56-76;  TV-0: 60"
    Option       "ConnectedMonitor"    "CRT-0, TV-0"
    Option       "TVStandard"          "PAL-B"
    Option       "TVOutFormat"         "SVIDEO" 
EndSection

```

Save changes, log out of the system, and restart X-Server by pressing **Ctrl-Alt-Backspace**. This should bring you back to the login screen. You will notice a clone of the screen will appear on your TV.

For more options and details, please see **[2]** and **[3]** in the **REFERENCES** section.

## Step 2: Using the correct settings for NVIDIA X Server Settings

Go to **NVIDIA X Server Settings**.

(In **KDE**, this is done by **K-menu** (icon) => **System** => **NVIDIA X Server Settings**).

In the section **X Screen 0**, there is an entry called **X Server XVideo Settings**, click on that.

Now you will see three entries:

1.  **Video Texture Adaptor**
    Enable => **Sync to VBlank** (Make sure this is checked with a tick)
2.  **Video Blitter Adaptor**
    Enable => **Sync to VBlank** (Make sure this is checked with a tick)
3.  **Sync to this display device**
    Select => **TV-0 (TV-0)**

Then click on **Quit** to save changes.

## Step 3: Using the correct settings for MPlayer

Now in MPlayer, right-click and select **Preferences**. Select the **Video** tab. Select **xv** in the **Available Drivers:** section.

Also enable (checkmark appears in box): **Enable double buffering**, **Enable direct rendering**, and **Enable frame dropping**.

Select **OK**, close MPlayer and then restart MPlayer to enable changes. Do a test with movie or video clip that contains lots of fast action scenes (eg: Anime). There should be little or no tearing when playing video through MPlayer on your TV.

If you still have issues with tearing, consider adjusting the values for **"VertRefresh"** first. As a last resort, you can also adjust the **modeline** in **xorg.conf**. See **[4]** and **[5]** in **REFERENCES** section for details.

## Step 4: Gnome Video Playback with Totem (Videos)

You can enable vsync on your driver's options if you like.

Edit /etc/enviroment and add the lines:

```
CLUTTER_PAINT=disable-clipped-redraws:disable-culling
CLUTTER_VBLANK=True

```

Then reboot your system.
