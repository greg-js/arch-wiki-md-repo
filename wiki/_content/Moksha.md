**Moksha** is a desktop environment created in 2014\. It is a fork of [Enlightenment](/index.php/Enlightenment "Enlightenment") 17 and it is currently used as default desktop environment in Ubuntu-based Bodhi Linux. Its chief advantage over later Enlightenment releases that are available in the extra repository is that it is more stable and has a significantly smaller memory footprint.
