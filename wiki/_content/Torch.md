# Torch

[Torch7](http://torch.ch) is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient implementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language, LuaJIT, and an underlying C implementation.

## Installation

Install [torch7](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/torch7/)<sup><small>AUR</small></sup><sup>[[broken link](/index.php/ArchWiki:Requests#Broken_package_links "ArchWiki:Requests"): archived in [aur-mirror](http://pkgbuild.com/git/aur-mirror.git/tree/torch7)]</sup> from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

I recommend you then follow through with the tutorial available here [[1]](http://code.madbits.com/wiki/doku.php?id=tutorial_basics).
