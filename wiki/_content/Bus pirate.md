# Bus pirate

The [Bus Pirate](http://code.google.com/p/the-bus-pirate/) is a versatile tool for communicating with various hardware.

Interfacing a new microchip can be a hassle. Breadboarding a circuit, writing code, hauling out the programmer, or maybe even prototyping a PCB. We never seem to get it right on the first try.

The ‘Bus Pirate’ is a universal bus interface that talks to most chips from a PC serial terminal, eliminating a ton of early prototyping effort when working with new or unknown chips. Many serial protocols are supported at 0-5.5volts, more can be added. See more at the google code site for the [Bus Pirate](http://code.google.com/p/the-bus-pirate/).

## Installation

**Note:** All scripts will assume that there is a '`/dev/buspirate`'.

The drivers for the FTDI chip is included in the kernel, so it should be detected as soon as it's plugged in, and assigned to device `/dev/ttyUSB[0-9]`. To check where it got assigned, run:

```
# dmesg | tail

```

The output will contain a line that looks something like this:

```
# usb 1-4.4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0

```

### udev

It can be annoying to have to look up what `/dev/ttyUSB[0-9]` the device gets assigned, so it's a good idea to add a simple udev rule that creates the symlink '`/dev/buspirate` -> `/dev/ttyUSB*`' when it is plugged in.

### Product/Vendor ID

There are several ways to do this, the way I personally prefer is to use it by vender/product ID so the bus pirate can be replaced without needing to modify the line. To use this method, add the following line to /etc/udev/rules.d/98-buspirate

 `/etc/udev/rules.d/98-buspirate.rules` 

```
# Bus pirate v3
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", GROUP="users", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="buspirate"
# Bus pirate v4
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="fb00", GROUP="users", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="buspirate"
```

### Serial Number

You can also do it by serial number, to do this, you will need to find out the serial number of FTDI chip on the bus pirate. This can be achieved by running the following, assuming your device is plugged in and was assigned to `/dev/ttyUSB0`:

```
# udevadm info --attribute-walk -n /dev/ttyUSB0  | sed -n '/FTDI/,/serial/p'

```

Now add/create the following file:

 `/etc/udev/rules.d/98-buspirate.rules` 

```
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{serial}=="XXXXXXXX", GROUP="users", MODE="0660", SYMLINK+="buspirate"

```

Change 'ATTRS{serial}=="XXXXXXXX"' to the serial on your device and force udev to load the new rule:

```
# udevadm control --reload-rules

```

At this point, whenever you plug in the device, the symlink should be created.

## Communication

To communicate with the device, you can use any of the following, to name a few:

*   `minicom`

```
# minicom -b 115200 -8 -D /dev/buspirate

```

*   `screen`

```
# screen /dev/buspirate 115200 8N1

```

*   `picocom`

```
# picocom -b 115200 -p n -d 8 /dev/buspirate

```

*   `cu`

```
# cu -l /dev/buspirate

```

Type '?' and press enter and the device should reply with a list of possible commands.
