# Machine-check exception

This article aims to help users implement services to actively monitor, log, and report hardware errors. A machine check exception (MCE) is an error generated by the CPU when the CPU detects that a hardware error or failure has occurred.

Machine check exceptions (MCEs) can occur for a variety of reasons ranging from undesired or out-of-spec voltages from the power supply, from cosmic radiation flipping bits in memory DIMMs or the CPU, or from other miscellaneous faults, including faulty software triggering hardware errors.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [mcelog](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=mcelog) package. [mcelog](http://www.mcelog.org/) written by Andi Kleen is one of the tools to gather MCE information.

## Configuration

mcelog's configuration file is located at `/etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf`. See `man mcelog`, `man mcelog.conf` and `man mcelog.triggers` for more information.

[Start](/index.php/Start "Start") and enable `mcelog.service`. By default, the service runs _mcelog_ as a daemon.
