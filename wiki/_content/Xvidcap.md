# Xvidcap

[XVidCap](http://xvidcap.sourceforge.net/) is a free software used for recording a screencast or digital recording of an X Window System screen output with an audio narration. With it you can make a movie of anything running on under X.

**Note:** Xvidcap is no longer maintained and some parts do no work any longer (like the ability to encode to video).
