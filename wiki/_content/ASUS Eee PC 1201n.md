This page contains instructions, tips, pointers, and links for installing and configuring Arch Linux on the ASUS EEE 1201n PC.

Aside from incompatability with cpufrequtils, the [eeepc 1201NL](/index.php/ASUS_Eee_PC_1201NL "ASUS Eee PC 1201NL") is very similar to this model, and most of the tips on that page apply to this model as well.

## Installing Wireless

The default eee 1201n carries a Realtek 8191 Wireless card, despite what lspci reports that the computer has a Realtek 8171 (rev 10). The wireless driver is included in linux 3 kernel and should work out of the box.

## cpufrequtils

The Intel Atom 330 does not support cpufrequtils in any reasonable way, so it is not recommended that you use cpufrequtils. You can disable it in /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/cpufreq.conf:

```
CONTROL_CPU_FREQUENCY=0

```

Because the Atom uses so little power anyway, controlling the FSB using the "SuperHybrid Engine" should provide significant gain in battery life without the need for CPU scaling.
