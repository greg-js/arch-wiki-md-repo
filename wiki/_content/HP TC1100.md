## Booting

Since the tablet has no internal cd-rom, booting from USB is the only option for getting into the installation media.

### USB Key

**Note:** I was unable to get the tablet to boot from a USB key. Use USB CD-Rom if posible

### USB CD/DVD Rom

1.  Plugin a USB CD-Rom drive with installation disk
2.  Attach keyboard (USB or Dock are fine)
3.  Boot computer
4.  While in BIOS post screen, press the "jog-dial" located on the top left edge
5.  Select "CD-Rom" and press jog-dial again

## Installation

Installation is the same as with any laptop. I recommend following the [Beginners' guide](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide "Beginners' guide")

## Post Install

For additional tablet related information, please read the [Tablet PC] page.

### Graphics

[Nouveau](/index.php/Nouveau "Nouveau") works fine, including the 3D support

### Power

Install and setup the following

*   [Cpufreq](/index.php/Cpufreq "Cpufreq")
*   [Pm-utils](/index.php/Pm-utils "Pm-utils")
*   [ACPI hotkeys](/index.php/ACPI_hotkeys "ACPI hotkeys") (acpi and acpid for suspend button to work)

#### Suspending and Resuming

Using [pm-utils](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=pm-utils), suspend to RAM works out of the box. Suspend to disk (hibernate) works once you have added the `resume` parameter to the kernel boot command and the `resume` hook to `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, as discussed in the [pm-utils](/index.php/Pm-utils "Pm-utils") article.

Resuming after suspending to disk causes the stylus to cease functioning. No data will be sent by the digitizer until it receives the `ISDV4_SAMPLING` command, which is merely the ASCII character "1" (49). Unfortunately, the [xf86-input-wacom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-wacom) driver only sends that particular command during initialization. I suppose the proper way to fix this would be to modify the driver to recognize when it's resuming from a suspend to disk and send the command accordingly. Of course, I didn't want to bother with all of that, so I put the following shell script in `/etc/pm/sleep.d` instead:

```
#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
 hibernate|resume|suspend )
  ;;
 thaw )
  xset -display :0 q 2>&1 | head -1 | grep -Eqx 'No protocol specified|Keyboard Control:' && printf 1 >>/dev/ttyS0
  ;;
 * )
  exit $NA
  ;;
esac
```

Please note that this script, as written, requires [xorg-xset](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xorg-xset).

### Stylus

Install the [xf86-input-wacom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-wacom) package. A reboot may be required for Xorg to recognize the serial digitizer For additional help, see the [Wacom](/index.php/Wacom "Wacom") page.

### Wireless

**TODO**

### Stylus Buttons

I've done a [quick and dirty hack](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B1SyqFJr-62rMXhPWUo2VVBYY28) of [xf86-input-wacom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-wacom) to get the stylus-activated buttons working.

Unpack it, build it using [makepkg](/index.php/Makepkg "Makepkg"), and install the resulting package with [pacman](/index.php/Pacman "Pacman"). The stylus buttons will now generate keycodes when triggered, and these can be bound to actions by either your [window manager](/index.php/Window_manager "Window manager") or [xbindkeys](/index.php/Xbindkeys "Xbindkeys"). The specific keycodes are as follows:

<table border="2">

<tbody>

<tr>

<th>Button</th>

<th>Keycode</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Rotate</td>

<td>KEY_DIRECTION (161)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Journal Launch</td>

<td>KEY_PROG3 (210)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Tablet PC Input Panel Launch</td>

<td>KEY_PROG4 (211)</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

### Right Hand Buttons

Side buttons work out of the box. Sometimes they do not respond until the unit is put into standby and then resumed

### Screen
