В біології, [мутулізм](http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Мутулізм) - взаємокорисний механізм співіснування декількох організмів. Даний принцип можна застосувати і по відношенню до активних і мотивованих учасників спільноти Arch, які бажають прийняти участь у її розвитку та внести свій вклад в улюблений дистрибутив GNU/Linux. Така діяльність приносить користь не лише учасникам спільноти Arch, а й, потенційно, всім фанам [вільного програмного забезпечення](http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Вільне_та_відкрите_програмне_забезпечення).

## Donate

Arch Linux survives because of the tireless efforts of many people in the community and the core development circle. None of us are paid for our work, and we do not have the personal funds to sustain server costs ourselves. There are many ways to help support Arch Linux. If technical development, documentation, or support aren't your strong points, you could certainly help us by [dropping a few bucks our way](https://www.archlinux.org/donate/).

## Forums

One of the easiest ways to get involved is participating in the [Arch Linux Forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/). Please read [Forum etiquette](/index.php/Forum_etiquette "Forum etiquette") first, then feel free to share your ideas, lend a helping hand to new users, and get to know your community. Use the forum Report feature (at the lower right of all forum posts) to alert the forum team of abuse.

## Wiki

Wikis, by design, thrive on collaboration.

[ArchWiki](/index.php/AboutWiki "AboutWiki") is a *community* documentation process. The contents are created *by* the community *for* the community. Contributors volunteer their time and energy to share their knowledge and skill with the community. *All* users are encouraged to contribute. Tasks on ArchWiki can roughly be divided into the following:

*   Technical maintenance
*   Content management
*   Content editing
*   Content creation and [translation](/index.php/ArchWiki_Translation_Team "ArchWiki Translation Team")

If you feel capable of [editing wiki pages](/index.php/Help:Editing "Help:Editing"), please see if you can manage tasks outlined in this section.

1.  Flag articles with appropriate [article status templates](/index.php/Help:Template#Article_status_templates "Help:Template") (e.g. `{{Deletion}}`, `{{Out of date}}`, `{{Translateme}}`, etc.)
2.  Add content to [stubs](/index.php/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Stub "Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Stub") and [expand](/index.php/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Expansion "Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Expansion") incomplete or poorly-written articles.
3.  [Add](/index.php/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Translateme "Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Translateme") or [improve](/index.php/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Bad_translation "Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Bad translation") translations; ensure that translations are in sync with each other.
4.  Reduce and [combine](/index.php/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Merge "Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Merge") duplicate pages.
5.  Correct [inaccurate](/index.php/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Accuracy "Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Accuracy") or [outdated](/index.php/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Out_of_date "Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Out of date") content, spelling, grammar, language, and [style](/index.php/Help:Style "Help:Style").
6.  Reduce the number of [categories](/index.php/Special:Categories "Special:Categories"). Scan the wiki for similar categories that should be combined; improve wiki [navigation](/index.php/Table_of_Contents "Table of Contents").
7.  [Categorize uncategorized pages](/index.php/Special:UncategorizedPages "Special:UncategorizedPages").
8.  Add [article summary](/index.php/Writing_Article_Overviews "Writing Article Overviews") boxes to all articles.
9.  Update the [FAQ](/index.php/FAQ "FAQ") with relevant questions from the forum and remove obsolete questions.

Other useful pages for cleanup:

*   [Requests](/index.php/ArchWiki:Requests "ArchWiki:Requests")
*   [Reports](/index.php/ArchWiki:Reports "ArchWiki:Reports")
*   [Broken redirects](/index.php/Special:BrokenRedirects "Special:BrokenRedirects")
*   [Double redirects](/index.php/Special:DoubleRedirects "Special:DoubleRedirects")
*   [Short pages](/index.php/Special:ShortPages "Special:ShortPages")

In the long run, the goal is a professional and easily-navigated wiki, such that supplementary guides, documenters, etc. are unnecessary. This is a community effort, but wiki maintenance is often a tedious and thankless task. If you take on the task seriously, a formal position as a wiki maintainer may be in order. This gives the job purpose and recognition.

## Bugs

Opening (and closing) bug reports on the [Arch Linux Bugtracker](https://bugs.archlinux.org/) is one of the possible ways to help the community. However, ineffective use of the bug-tracker can be counter-productive instead of being useful. [This article](/index.php/Reporting_bug_guidelines "Reporting bug guidelines") will guide anyone wanting to help the community efficiently by reporting or hunting bugs.

## AUR

The [Arch User Repository](/index.php/Arch_User_Repository "Arch User Repository") is a community-driven repository of PKGBUILDs for Arch users. Packages in the AUR are built by the PKGBUILDs and are not pre-built binaries like from the official repositories. The AUR was created to organize and share new packages from the community and to help expedite popular packages' inclusion into the `[community]` repository.

## 'Rolling Release' ezine

Contribute to [Rolling Release](http://rollingrelease.com), the official Arch Linux ezine. It is a community-backed, web-based publication that is always looking for contributers, artists, and the like.

## Arch projects

You can find here the list of git repositories for [official Arch Projects](https://projects.archlinux.org/).

## Community projects

Arch has a vital and active community of software developers and contributing projects. If you have a project you would like to link to, this is a great place to do it. Include a link to your project, the date your project started, and a brief (one or two sentence) description of your project.

**Note:** All projects listed here are community projects. None of these projects are considered ***official*** Arch projects.

## As a developer...

Firstly, remember that the main motivation for your work on Arch should be helping the whole community, and not trying to become an *"Arch developer"* by any means. Secondly, you are also part of the community; to provide help to others means you will also help yourself.

### What can I do?

Here is a list, in no particular order, of things that you may want to do in order to make yourself useful to the community:

*   Establish a reputation as being helpful by offering assistance whenever possible
*   Answer questions on the forum, IRC, and mailing lists
*   Join the Trusted Users to gain packaging experience to show your skills
*   Submit packages to the AUR
*   Join one of the offshoot projects that may be incorporated into Arch mainstream someday, or start your own
*   Work on pacman, makepkg, initscripts, or other source code and submit patches to the bug tracker
*   Traverse the bug tracker and fix existing bugs
*   Find and submit new bugs
*   Fix wiki errors, add new pages, clean up existing pages, and make sure the procedures are up-to-date
*   Help patrolling the Recent Changes in the wiki
*   Submit translations

### How can I become an Arch developer?

Usually, new developers are picked by the existing developers as the workload increases. Sometimes they post a position and you can apply to fill it, but more often, they just invite somebody they know would be good at it and would fit in well with the rest of the team. Having a portfolio of Arch contributions is the best way to make it on the team.

## As an artist...

Feel free to share wallpapers, splash screens, color palettes, widgets, themes, etc. with the community on the forum.
