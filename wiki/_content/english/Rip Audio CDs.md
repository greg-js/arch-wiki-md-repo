## Introduction

Music is usually stored on audio CDs in an uncompressed format which requires a lot of space (e.g. 700MB for only 80 minutes of audio). This is because they have a constant high bitrate of over one megabyte per second. Extracting the audio from the CD usually involves compressing it so that it requires less space using:

*   Lossless compression: same quality, less space.
*   Lossy compression: lower quality, much less space.

Most common formats to convert to are: APE or FLAC for lossless and MP3 or OGG for lossy.

## Ripping

See [Optical disc drive#Ripping](/index.php/Optical_disc_drive#Ripping "Optical disc drive") for a list of available software. For example, to extract audio with *cdrtools*:

```
$ cdda2wav -vall cddb=0 speed=4 -paranoia paraopts=proof -B -D /dev/sr0

```

**Note:** Some CD rippers support burning audio to a CD and transcoding on-the-fly.

### Create cue files

To allow *cdda2wav* to create CUE files, you must also specify `-t all` to switch *cdda2wav* into a mode that creates a single audio data file for the whole CD.

Alternatively to create a bin and cue file pair from an audio CD use [cdrdao](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=cdrdao). For example:

```
$ cdrdao read-cd --read-raw --datafile cdimage.bin cdimage.cue

```

The cue file generated by this method is not the same as some may expect from tools like [EAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_Audio_Copy "wikipedia:Exact Audio Copy"). To convert the *cdrdao* formatted cue files to a "standard" cue file, try [yatoc2cue](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yatoc2cue/).

## Post-processing

### Tag editors

For some examples of audio tag editors see [List of applications/Multimedia#Audio tag editors](/index.php/List_of_applications/Multimedia#Audio_tag_editors "List of applications/Multimedia").

### Convert to other formats

Re-encoding to another format can be done with [lame](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=lame) or [FFmpeg](/index.php/FFmpeg "FFmpeg"). For example, to convert the output raw audio files from the example in [#Ripping](#Ripping) to best quality MP3 with variable bit rate:

```
$ lame -V0 *input*.wav *output*.mp3

```

To convert them to FLAC instead:

```
$ ffmpeg -i *input*.wav *output*.flac

```
