## Package maintainer

*   Developers who maintains packages in the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories") (core, extra, or testing).
*   [Trusted Users](/index.php/Trusted_User "Trusted User") who maintain packages in the community repository.

The maintainer of a package is the person currently responsible for the package. Previous maintainers should be listed as contributors in the PKGBUILD along with others who have contributed to the package.
