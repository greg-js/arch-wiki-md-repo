[Darcs](http://darcs.net/) is a free and open source, cross-platform version control system, like git, mercurial or subversion but with a very different approach. Thanks to its focus on changes rather than snapshots, Darcs can offer a freer way of working, and a simpler user interface.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [darcs](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=darcs) package.
