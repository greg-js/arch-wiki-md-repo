[Darcs](http://darcs.net/) is a free and open source, cross-platform version control system, like git, mercurial or subversion but with a very different approach. Thanks to its focus on changes rather than snapshots, Darcs can offer a freer way of working, and a simpler user interface.

## Installation

There is no official package for that, but you could installing via [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") package [darcs-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/darcs-bin/).
