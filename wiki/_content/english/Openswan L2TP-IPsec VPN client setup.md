This article describes how to configure and use a L2TP/IPsec Virtual Private Network client on Arch Linux. It covers the installation and setup of several needed software packages. L2TP refers to the [w:Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol "w:Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol") and for [w:IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec "w:IPsec"), the [Openswan](https://www.openswan.org/) implementation is employed.

This guide is primarily targeted for clients connecting to a Windows Server machine, as it uses some settings that are specific to the Microsoft implementation of L2TP/IPsec. However, it is adaptable with any other common L2TP/IPsec setup. The [Openswan wiki](https://github.com/xelerance/Openswan/wiki/L2tp-ipsec-configuration-using-openswan-and-xl2tpd) features instructions to set up a corresponding L2TP/IPSec Linux server.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [xl2tpd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xl2tpd) from the repos and [openswan](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openswan/) from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

Make sure that the openswan service is running with `systemctl start openswan.service`, or you may get an error message about a missing pluto_ctl `connect(pluto_ctl) failed: No such file or directory`.

Run `ipsec verify` to check your configuration and resolve possible issues before continuing.

## Configuration

### OpenSwan

Edit `/etc/ipsec.conf` to contain the following lines:

```
config setup
     virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12
     nat_traversal=yes
     protostack=netkey
     oe=no
# Replace eth0 with your network interface
     plutoopts="--interface=eth0"
conn L2TP-PSK
     authby=secret
     pfs=no
     auto=add
     keyingtries=3
     dpddelay=30
     dpdtimeout=120
     dpdaction=clear
     rekey=yes
     ikelifetime=8h
     keylife=1h
     type=transport
# Replace %any below with your local IP address (private, behind NAT IP is okay as well)
     left=%any
     leftprotoport=17/1701
# Replace IP address with your VPN server's IP
     right=68.68.32.79
     rightprotoport=17/1701

```

This file contains the basic information to establish a secure IPsec tunnel to the VPN server. It enables NAT Traversal for if your machine is behind a NAT'ing router (most people are), and various other options that are necessary to connect correctly to the remote IPsec server. The next file contains your pre-shared key (PSK) for the server.

Create the file `/etc/ipsec.secrets`: It should contain the following line:

```
%any 68.68.32.79Â : PSK "**your_pre_shared_key**"

```

Remember to replace the local (%any) and remote (68.68.32.79) IP addresses with the correct numbers for your location. The pre-shared key will be supplied by the VPN provider and will need to be placed in this file in cleartext form.

Add the connection, so it's available to use:

```
 $ ipsec auto --add L2TP-PSK

```

At this point the IPsec configuration is complete and we can move on to the L2TP configuration.

### xl2tpd

Edit `/etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf`: It should resemble the following:

```
[lac vpn-connection]
lns = 68.68.32.79
ppp debug = yes
pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client
length bit = yes

```

This file configures xl2tpd with the connection name, server IP address(which again, please remember to change to your servers address) and various options that will be passed to pppd once the tunnel is set up.

Now modify `/etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client`:

```
ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
refuse-eap
require-mschap-v2
noccp
noauth
idle 1800
mtu 1410
mru 1410
defaultroute
usepeerdns
debug
connect-delay 5000
name **your_vpn_username**
password **your_password**

```

Place your assigned username and password for the VPN server in this file. A lot of these options are for interoperability with Windows Server L2TP servers. If your VPN server uses PAP authentication, replace `require-mschap-v2` with `require-pap`.

Create the control file for xl2tpd:

```
$ mkdir -p /var/run/xl2tpd
$ touch /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control

```

This concludes the configuration of the applicable software suites to connect to a L2TP/IPsec server. To start the connection do the following:

```
$ systemctl start openswan
$ systemctl start xl2tpd
$ ipsec auto --up L2TP-PSK
$ echo "c vpn-connection" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control

```

At this point the tunnel is up and you should be able to see the interface for it if you type:

```
$ ip link

```

You should see a `pppX` device that represents the tunnel. Right now, nothing is going to get routed through it. You need to add some routing rules to make it work right:

## Routing

### Routing traffic to a single IP address through the tunnel

This is as easy as adding a routing rule to your kernel table:

```
 # ip route add xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx via yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy dev eth0

```

Replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with the specific ip address of the server that you wish to communicate with through the tunnel, then replace yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy with the remote IP your PPP connection. The remote IP of a PPP connection can be discovered by issuing:

```
 # ip a

```

and reading the P-t-P address for the PPP interface that corresponds to your tunnel.

### Routing all traffic through the tunnel

This is a lot more complex, but all your traffic will travel through the tunnel. Start by adding a special route for the actual VPN server through your current gateway:

```
 # ip route add 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

```

This will ensure that once the default gateway is changed to the ppp interface that your network stack can still find the VPN server by routing around the tunnel. If you miss this step you will lose connectivity to the Internet and the tunnel will collapse. Now add a default route that routes to the PPP remote end:

```
 # ip route add default via yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy dev eth0

```

The remote PPP end can be discovered by following the step in the previous section. Now to ensure that ALL traffic is routing through the tunnel, delete the original default route:

```
 # ip route delete default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

```

To restore your system to the previous state, you can reboot or reverse all of the above steps.

The route creation can also be automated by placing a script in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d.

## Troubleshooting

**Note:** The first step may be to use the **ipsec verify** command to check the configuration of the installed IPSEC.

**Issue:** I get a message from pppd saying "Failed to authenticate ourselves to peer" and I've verified my password is correct. What could be wrong?

**Solution:** If you see the following in your /var/log/daemon.log:

```
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: rcvd [CHAP Challenge id=0x1 <some_or_another_hash>, name = "SonicWALL"]
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: sent [CHAP Response id=0x1 <some_or_another_hash>, name = "your_vpn_username"]
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: rcvd [LCP EchoRep id=0x0 magic=0x45c269c6]
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: rcvd [CHAP Failure id=0x1 ""]
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: CHAP authentication failed
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: CHAP authentication failed
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: sent [LCP TermReq id=0x3 "Failed to authenticate ourselves to peer"]
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: rcvd [LCP TermReq id=0x2]
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: sent [LCP TermAck id=0x2]
Dec 20 15:14:03 myhost pppd[26529]: rcvd [LCP TermAck id=0x3]
```

then you are authenticating against a SonicWALL LNS that does not know how to handle CHAP-style authentication correctly.

The solution to this is to add the following to your options.l2tp.client file:

```
   refuse-chap

```

This will cause the SonicWALL to default to the next authentication mechanism, namely MSCHAP-v2\. This should authenticate successfully, and from this point xl2tpd should successfully construct a tunnel between you and the remote L2TP server.

## Tips and Tricks

### Script start up and shut down

You can create some scripts either in your home directory or elsewhere(remember where you put them) to bring up the tunnel then shut it back down.

First, a utility script to automatically discover PPP distant ends: getip.sh

```
  #!/bin/bash

  /sbin/ifconfig $1 | grep "P-t-P" | gawk -F: '{print $2}' | gawk '{print $1}'

```

Next, the script to bring the tunnel up. This will replace the default route, so all traffic will pass via the tunnel: startvpn.sh

```

  #!/bin/bash

  /etc/rc.d/openswan start
  sleep 2                                                   #delay to ensure that IPsec is started before overlaying L2TP
  /etc/rc.d/xl2tpd start
  /usr/sbin/ipsec auto --up L2TP-PSK                        
  /bin/echo "c vpn-connection" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control     
  sleep 2                                                   #delay again to make that the PPP connection is up.
  PPP_GW_ADD=`./getip.sh ppp0`

  ip route add 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
  ip route add default via $PPP_GW_ADD
  ip route del default via 192.168.1.1

```

Finally, the shutdown script, it simply reverses the process: stopvpn.sh

```
  #!/bin/bash

  /usr/sbin/ipsec auto --down L2TP-PSK
  /bin/echo "d vpn-connection" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
  /etc/rc.d/xl2tpd stop
  /etc/rc.d/openswan stop

  ip route del 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
  ip route add default via 192.168.1.1

```

### A further script

Above script really help me work. And notice the script use fixed ip, and someone like me may change net vpn addr, i'd like to put my further script below(not sure how to add attachment, so just raw ):

```
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# != 1 ] ; then
	echo "Usage: (sudo) sh $0 {init|start|stop}" 
	exit 1;
fi

VPN_ADDR=XXX
IFACE=wlan0

function getIP(){
	/sbin/ifconfig $1 |grep "inet "|awk '{print $2}'
}

function getGateWay(){
	/sbin/route -n |grep -m 1 "^0\.0\.0\.0" |awk '{print $2}'
}
function getVPNGateWay(){
	/sbin/route -n |grep -m 1 "$VPN_ADDR" |awk '{print $2}'
}

GW_ADDR=$(getGateWay)  

function init(){
	cp ./options.l2tpd.client /etc/ppp/
	cp ./ipsec.conf /etc/
	cp ./ipsec.secrets /etc/
	cp ./xl2tpd.conf /etc/xl2tpd/
}

function start(){
	sed -i "s/^lns =.*/lns = $VPN_ADDR/g" /etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf
	sed -i "s/plutoopts=.*/plutoopts=\"--interface=$IFACE\"/g" /etc/ipsec.conf
	sed -i "s/left=.*$/left=$(getIP $IFACE)/g" /etc/ipsec.conf
	sed -i "s/right=.*$/right=$VPN_ADDR/g" /etc/ipsec.conf
	sed -i "s/^.*: PSK/$(getIP $IFACE) $VPN_ADDR : PSK/g" /etc/ipsec.secrets
	/etc/rc.d/openswan start
	sleep 2    #delay to ensure that IPsec is started before overlaying L2TP

	/etc/rc.d/xl2tpd start
	/usr/sbin/ipsec auto --up L2TP-PSK                        
	/bin/echo "c vpn-connection" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control     
	sleep 2    #delay again to make that the PPP connection is up.

	route add $VPN_ADDR gw $GW_ADDR $IFACE
	route add default gw $(getIP ppp0)
	route delete default gw $GW_ADDR
}

function stop(){
	/usr/sbin/ipsec auto --down L2TP-PSK
	/bin/echo "d vpn-connection" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
	/etc/rc.d/xl2tpd stop
	/etc/rc.d/openswan stop

	VPN_GW=$(getVPNGateWay)
	route delete $VPN_ADDR gw $VPN_GW $IFACE
	route add default gw $VPN_GW
}

$1
exit 0

```
