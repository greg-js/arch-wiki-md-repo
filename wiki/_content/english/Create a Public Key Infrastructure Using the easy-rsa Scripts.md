The first step when setting up OpenVPN is to create a [Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure "wikipedia:Public key infrastructure"). The PKI consists of:

*   A public master [Certificate Authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Authority "wikipedia:Certificate Authority") certificate and a private key.
*   A separate public certificate and private key pair (hereafter referred to as a certificate) for each server and each client.

To facilitate the certificate creation process, OpenVPN comes with a collection of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm) "wikipedia:RSA (algorithm)") key manangement scripts (based on the openssl command line tool) known as easy-rsa.

**Note:** Only .key files need to be kept secret, .crt and .csr files can be sent over insecure channels such as plaintext email.

In this article the needed certificates are created by root in root's home directory. This ensures that the generated files have the right ownership and permissions, and are safe from other users.

**Note:** The certificates can be created on any machine. For the highest security, generate the certificates on a physically secure machine disconnected from any network, and make sure that the generated ca.key private key is backed up and never accessible to anyone.

**Warning:** Make sure that the generated files are backed up, especially the ca.key and ca.crt files, since if lost you will not be able to create any new, nor revoke any compromised certificates, thus requiring the generation of a new [Certificate Authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Authority "wikipedia:Certificate Authority") certificate, invalidating the entire PKI infrastructure.

### Installing the easy-rsa scripts

Install the scripts by doing the following:

 `# pacman -S easy-rsa`  `# cp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa /root` 

### Creating certificates

Change to the directory where you installed the scripts.

 `# cd /root/easy-rsa` 

To ensure the consistent use of values when generating the PKI, set default values to be used by the PKI generating scripts. Edit /root/easy-rsa/vars and at a minimum set the KEY_COUNTRY, KEY_PROVINCE, KEY_CITY, KEY_ORG, and KEY_EMAIL parameters (do not leave any of these parameters blank). Change the KEY_SIZE parameter to 2048 for the SSL/TLS to use 2048bit RSA keys for authentication.

 `/root/easy-rsa/vars` 

```
# easy-rsa parameter settings

# NOTE: If you installed from an RPM,
# do not edit this file in place in
# /usr/share/openvpn/easy-rsa --
# instead, you should copy the whole
# easy-rsa directory to another location
# (such as /etc/openvpn) so that your
# edits will not be wiped out by a future
# OpenVPN package upgrade.

# This variable should point to
# the top level of the easy-rsa
# tree.

**export KEY_SIZE=2048**

# In how many days should the root CA key expire?
export CA_EXPIRE=3650

# In how many days should certificates expire?
export KEY_EXPIRE=3650

# These are the default values for fields
# which will be placed in the certificate.
# Do not leave any of these fields blank.

**export KEY_COUNTRY="US"**
**export KEY_PROVINCE="CA"**

Export the environment variables.

Generate a secret [Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC "wikipedia:HMAC") by running: `# openvpn --genkey --secret /root/easy-rsa/keys/ta.key` (This is no typo -- the command generates a ta.key file)

This will be used to add an additional HMAC signature to all SSL/TLS handshake packets. In addition any UDP packet not having the correct HMAC signature will be immediately dropped, protecting against:

*   Portscanning.
*   DOS attacks on the OpenVPN UDP port.
*   SSL/TLS handshake initiations from unauthorized machines.
*   Any eventual buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the SSL/TLS implementation.

All the created keys and certificates have been stored in /root/easy-rsa/keys. If you make a mistake, you can start over by running the clean-all script again.

**Warning:** This will delete any previously generated certificates stored in /root/easy-rsa/keys, including the [Certificate Authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Authority "wikipedia:Certificate Authority") certificate.

### Converting certificates to encrypted .p12 format

Some software (such as Android) will only read VPN certificates that are stored in a password-encrypted .p12 file. These can be generated with the following command:

 `# openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey keys/bugs.key -in keys/bugs.crt -certfile keys/ca.crt -out keys/bugs.p12`
