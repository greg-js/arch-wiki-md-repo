[gnome-software](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gnome-software) allows you to find and install new applications and system extensions and remove existing installed applications.

## Arch Official Repositories ([PackageKit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/PackageKit/pk-intro.html) Plugin)

Out of the box, [gnome-software](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gnome-software) doesn't give you the ability to use Arch repos in the software centre, so you will have to install the PackageKit plugin built for GNOME Software from the repos.

To enable the Arch repos in GNOME Software, install the [gnome-software-packagekit-plugin](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gnome-software-packagekit-plugin) package and restart the program to enable them permanently.

**Note:** This will not enable the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).

## Flatpak

Head over to [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup/Arch/)'s website. It will enable the Flatpak repos in GNOME Software automatically.
