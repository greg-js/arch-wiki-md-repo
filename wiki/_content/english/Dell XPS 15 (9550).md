This page covers the current status of hardware support on Arch, pre-installation system configuration tweaks, as well as post-installation recommendations to improve the usability of the system.

The installation process for Arch on the XPS 15 9550 does not differ from any other PC. For installation help please see the [Installation guide](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide") and [UEFI](/index.php/UEFI "UEFI"). To set up a dual boot configuration with Windows, refer to [Dual boot with Windows](/index.php/Dual_boot_with_Windows "Dual boot with Windows").

As of kernel 4.3, the Intel Skylake architecture is supported.

Installation of Arch can proceed normally. Refer to the [Installation guide](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide") for more info.

## Boot Parameters

**The following is only required on older kernels - these issues have been fixed by more recent kernels and by BIOS updates:**

Use the following for your [Kernel parameters](/index.php/Kernel_parameters "Kernel parameters") to fix a number of issues:

`i915.edp_vswing=2 i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 intel_idle.max_cstate=1 acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux`

| **Parameter** | **Function** |
| `i915.edp_vswing=2` | Fix screen flickering |
| `i915.preliminary_hw_support=1` | Resolve issues with Intel Graphics |
| `intel_idle.max_cstate=1` | Prevent CPU from entering [c-states](https://gist.github.com/wmealing/2dd2b543c4d3cff6cab7) > 1 |
| `acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux` | make [Backlight](/index.php/Backlight "Backlight") control work |

## Graphics Configuration

The Dell XPS 15 9550 has Intel HD Graphics 530 integrated graphics, and some models have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 dedicated card as well in a hybrid configuration.

For computers with only integrated graphics, just install the [xf86-video-intel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-intel) driver.

If your XPS has a hybrid graphics configuration (GTX960M + HD Graphics 530) and you want to maximize battery life you can just use the Intel Graphics.

### Intel Only

If your model comes with an nVidia card which you don't use then you can try to disable it with an ACPI command. Depending on the model, this can have a small to profound effect on the laptop's temperature and battery life (it can more than double battery life!)

*   Install the Intel video driver using the [xf86-video-intel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-intel) package.
*   Blacklist the `nvidia` & `nouveau` modules [Kernel modules#Blacklisting](/index.php/Kernel_modules#Blacklisting "Kernel modules")
*   Power down the GPU [with an ACPI command](/index.php/Hybrid_graphics#Fully_Power_Down_Discrete_GPU "Hybrid graphics")

### Optimus Configuration (Hybrid Intel and Nvidia)

The [Optimus](/index.php/Optimus "Optimus") setup consists of the integrated Intel chip connected to the laptop screen and the Nvidia card runs through this. As such, the Nvidia chip cannot be used without the Intel chip (some other laptops have the option in BIOS to turn Intel off and use just Nvidia, but not this laptop). See the [Bumblebee](/index.php/Bumblebee "Bumblebee") page set of instructions, particularly the [Bumblebee#Installation](/index.php/Bumblebee#Installation "Bumblebee") Intel/Nvidia section. The main thing to note is that installing both the Intel and Nvidia packages at once tends to avoid dependency issues. The correct driver for the Nvidia card is [nvidia](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nvidia).

## Touchpad

By default the touchpad does not respond to tap input or two finger scrolling. You can change the behavior by installing [Libinput](/index.php/Libinput "Libinput") and adding `30-touchpad.conf` to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`:

```
 Section "InputClass"
     Identifier "MyTouchPad"
     MatchIsTouchpad "on"
     Driver "libinput"
     Option "Tapping" "on"
     Option "Natural Scrolling" "on"
 EndSection

```

### Gestures

You can configure custom gestures using the [libinput-gestures](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libinput-gestures/) package. You can follow the instructions from the [documentation](https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures#readme). Below is a sample configuration file that one might use with this tool:

```
 # ~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf

 # Go back/forward in chrome
 gesture: swipe right 3 xdotool key Alt+Left
 gesture: swipe left 3 xdotool key Alt+Right

 # Zoom in / Zoom out
 gesture: pinch out xdotool key Ctrl+plus
 gesture: pinch in xdotool key Ctrl+minus

 # Switch between desktops
 gesture: swipe left 4 xdotool set_desktop --relative 1
 gesture: swipe right 4 xdotool set_desktop --relative -- -1

```

## Power Management

### Suspend & Hibernate

Suspend works without issues, however Hibernation is not completely stable. Write the following to `/etc/systemd/sleep.conf`:

```
 [Sleep]
 HibernateState=disk
 HibernateMode=shutdown

```

### Battery

Battery life can be improved by installing [powertop](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=powertop) and calibrating it. See [Powertop](/index.php/Powertop "Powertop") for more info. To further improve the battery life, you can disable the touchscreen in the BIOS.

## Bluetooth

Bluetooth is disabled by default. If you wish to use Bluetooth you'll need to install some firmware. See [Bluetooth](/index.php/Bluetooth "Bluetooth") and [bug report](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/21797) for details.

[bcm20703a1-firmware](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bcm20703a1-firmware/) includes includes the firmware necessary for the Broadcom BCM20703A1 Bluetooth device.

## Thunderbolt 3 Docks

It is possible to get video, audio, Ethernet and USB devices working by updating your BIOS to version >=1.2.19 and disabling Thunderbolt security in your bios settings. If you don't disable Thunderbolt security, then only video and power will work (at lest on the Dell TB16 dock).

On bios version 1.4.0 the USB and Ethernet peripherals will not work unless Thunderbolt security and Thunderbolt Boot support options are disabled.

Using [bolt](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=bolt) allows to use all features of the dock with Thunderbolt security activated.

It should also be noted that the TB16 dock will crash when hot plugged on all BIOS versions after 1.2.18 (Still the case as of version 1.4.0, but no longer as of version 1.8.1).

## BIOS/firmware Updates

You can update your BIOS either [manually](http://www.dell.com/support/article/hr/en/hrdhs1/SLN171755/en), or with [fwupdmgr](/index.php/Fwupd "Fwupd") (recommended). Recent BIOSes fix the screen flickering issue previously worked around with the `i915.edp_vswing=2` kernel parameter.
