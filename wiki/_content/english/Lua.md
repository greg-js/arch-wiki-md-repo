[Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language) "wikipedia:Lua (programming language)"), according to its own website [lua.org](https://www.lua.org/), is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. This makes Lua ideal for configuration and extensions of other programs, also because of its great interoperation with [C](/index.php/C "C"). The basic Lua interpreter is less than 250kB in size. As the official implementation is written in [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C "wikipedia:ANSI C") it is available for many platforms and architectures.

*   [lua51](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=lua51) — Lua 5.1

### LuaJIT

The repositories also offer the [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/), a [Just-in-time compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation "wikipedia:Just-in-time compilation") as [luajit](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=luajit) which implements the language as version 5.1\. This version is best suited for higher performance constrains.
