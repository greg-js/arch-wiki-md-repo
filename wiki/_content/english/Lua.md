[Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language) "wikipedia:Lua (programming language)"), according to its own website [lua.org](https://www.lua.org/) is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. This makes Lua ideal for configuration and extensions of other programs, also because of its great interoperation with C. The basic Lua interpreter is less than 250kB in size.
