## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [logmein-hamachi](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/logmein-hamachi/) package.

## Configuration

### Hamachi 2 (beta)

Hamachi 2 is configured in `/var/lib/logmein-hamachi/h2-engine-override.cfg` (create that file if it doesn't exist). Unfortunately, it isn't easy to find a comprehensive list of possible configuration options, so here are a few that you can use.

#### Using the hamachi command line tool as a regular user

In order to use the `hamachi` command line tool as a regular user, add the following line to the configuration file:

```
Ipc.User YourUserNameHere

```

#### Automatically setting a custom nickname

Normally, Hamachi uses your system's hostname as the nickname that other Hamachi users will see. If you want to automatically set a custom nickname every time Hamachi starts, add the following line to the configuration file:

```
Setup.AutoNick YourNicknameHere

```

You can also manually set a nickname using the `hamachi` command line tool:

```
# hamachi set-nick YourNicknameHere

```

However, this needs to be done every time Hamachi is (re-)started, so if you always want to use the same nickname, setting it automatically (as explained above) is probably easier.

## Running Hamachi

[Start](/index.php/Start "Start") `logmein-hamachi.service`.

Now you have a whole bunch of commands at your disposal. These are in no particular order and are fairly self explanatory.

```
$ hamachi set-nick bob
$ hamachi login
$ hamachi create my-net secretpassword
$ hamachi go-online my-net
$ hamachi list
$ hamachi go-offline my-net

```

To get a list of all the commands, run: $ hamachiÂ ?

**Note:** Make sure you change the status of the channel(s) you are in to "online" if you want to perform any network actions on computers in there.

### Systemd

The [logmein-hamachi](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/logmein-hamachi/) package also includes a nice little [Systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") daemon.

If you feel like it, you can set Hamachi to start at every boot with Systemd by [enabling](/index.php/Enabling "Enabling") `logmein-hamachi.service`.
