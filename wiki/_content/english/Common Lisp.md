## Implementations

There are multiple implementations available:

*   **[CLISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLISP "wikipedia:CLISP")** — ANSI Common Lisp interpreter, compiler and debugger

	[https://clisp.sourceforge.io/](https://clisp.sourceforge.io/) || [clisp](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=clisp)

*   **[CMUCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Common_Lisp "wikipedia:CMU Common Lisp")** — CMU Common Lisp

	[https://www.cons.org/cmucl/](https://www.cons.org/cmucl/) || [cmucl](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=cmucl)

*   **[ECL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embeddable_Common_Lisp "wikipedia:Embeddable Common Lisp")** — Embeddable Common Lisp

	[https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/](https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/) || [ecl](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=ecl)

*   **[SBCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Bank_Common_Lisp "wikipedia:Steel Bank Common Lisp")** — Steel Bank Common Lisp

	[http://www.sbcl.org/](http://www.sbcl.org/) || [sbcl](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=sbcl)

SBCL features a highly optimized native code generating compiler with origins that date back to the early 90's. Known for its precise type derivation and its strict conformance to the ANSI standard, it is particularly suited for general purpose and scientific programming. On the other hand, both ECL and CLISP offer good C integration and embeddability.

## Quicklisp

[Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) ([quicklisp](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quicklisp/)) is a package manager written in common lisp for loading common lisp libraries. It works across all major common lisp implementations, and is the dominant choice for maintaining common lisp packages within the common lisp community.

## SLIME

For the interactive experience that Common Lisp is known for, see [slime](/index.php/Slime "Slime").
