## Network Interfaces

The first step in troubleshooting network issues will be to identify which network interfaces are present on the system. See [Network configuration#Get current device names](/index.php/Network_configuration#Get_current_device_names "Network configuration") for details.

## Link status

In the overview of `ip a`, the link status will already be displayed. But it can also be displayed by running:

```
$ ip link show dev eth0

```

This will provide an output along the lines of:

```
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN qlen 1000
   link/ether 70:5a:b6:8a:a0:87 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

```

Bringing up an interface can be done by issueing:

```
# ip link set dev eth0 up

```

#### RTNETLINK answers: Cannot assign requested address

If you get this error when trying to set an interface up, its most probably because you've got an invalid MAC address. To set a working MAC, see [MAC address spoofing](/index.php/MAC_address_spoofing "MAC address spoofing").

## IP address

In the overview provided by `ip a`, the ip address will already be displayed. But it can also be displayed by running:

```
$ ip addr show dev eth0

```

This will provide an output along the lines of:

```
 2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
   link/ether 70:5a:b6:8a:a0:87 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   inet 192.168.1.143/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global eth0
   inet6 fe80::725a:b6ff:fe8a:a087/64 scope link 
      valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```

Adding a temporary ip address:

```
# ip addr add 192.168.1.143/24 dev eth0

```

Removing an ip address:

```
# ip addr del 192.168.1.143/24 dev eth0

```

## Route table

The route table can be displayed by running:

```
$ ip route show

```

Route table for a specific interface:

```
$ ip route show dev eth0

```

This will provide an output along the lines of:

```
default via 192.168.1.1  proto static 
192.168.1.0/24  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.143

```

Configuring the default gateway:

```
# ip route add 0/0 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

```

Removing the default gateway:

```
# ip route del 0/0 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

```

## DNS Servers

Dns is responsible for converting hostnames to an ip address. When connectivity towards ip addresses is working, but the system is unable to connect to a hostname; there is a fair chance that this will be related to the dns configuration. The configuration can be displayed by running:

```
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf

```

This will provide an output among the lines of:

```
domain example.com
search example.com
nameserver 192.168.1.1

```

*   The rule '`nameserver`' is the relevant section. Configuring multiple nameservers is supported.
*   The '`domain`' and '`search`' rules are optional.
*   Often the '`nameserver`' is the same as your default gateway.
*   In case of doubt there is always the possibility to use the Google DNS servers as your default DNS servers:

```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

```

Testing your dns configuration can be done through the `drill` command (from the [ldns](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=ldns) package):

```
$ drill www.archlinux.org @8.8.4.4

```

The above command will perform a dns lookup of www.archlinux.org using the 8.8.4.4 dns server and return output as follows:

```
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 35144
;; flags: qr rd raÂ ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

```

As an alternative to _drill_, there are also the `dig`, `host`, and `nslookup` tools from the [bind-tools](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=bind-tools) package.

## Ping & Tracepath/Traceroute

The ping command can help test connectivity towards a specific host.

The first step would be verifying connectivity towards the default gateway (replace the ip address with your own default gateway):

```
$ ping -c4 192.168.1.1

```

When erasing the "-c4" parameter, the ping will continue endlessly. It can be aborted by hitting "Control-C".

```
PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.193 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.190 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=0.192 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_req=4 ttl=64 time=0.189 ms

--- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 2999ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.165/0.184/0.193/0.014 ms

```

The output above indicated the default gateway is reachable. When instead a "`Destination Host Unreachable`" message is displayed, doublecheck the ip address, netmask and default gateway config. This message can also be displayed when ICMP traffic is not permitted towards the default gateway (blocked by a firewall, router,...).

The next step is verifying connectivity towards the configured dns server(s). When no reply is received, `tracepath` or `traceroute` can be used to verify the routing towards said server and get an idea of where the issue lies.

```
$ traceroute 8.8.4.4

```

Traceroute also used ICMP to determine the path and hence there can be "no reply" answers as well when ICMP traffic is blocked.
