To prevent accidental deletion of files, you can use a trash can. To ensure compatibility between multiple applications, you can use software (CLI, GUI or Library) that follow the [FreeDesktop.org's Trash specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html).

**Note:** Some applications can use a trash can per filesystem (see the specification)

**Warning:** When deleting a file on another filesystem, usage of a trash can might lead to a copy between filesystems, leading to some latency

## Trash creation

*   **trash-cli** â€” A command-line interface implementing [FreeDesktop.org's Trash specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html).

## Trash space usage management

To prevent the trash can from using to much space, you can empty it yourself, or have a pruning policy

### Software list

autotrash (not in the AUR)

### Criterias

*   make sure to have at least x MB of free space
*   delete files older than x days
*   only empty if you have less than x MB of free space (useful in combination of previous criteria)
*   maximum trash can size
*   file size
*   file type
*   original path

### Automation

To automate emptying the trash can, you can use [cron](/index.php/Cron "Cron"), [systemd/Timers](/index.php/Systemd/Timers "Systemd/Timers"), or [inotify](/index.php/Inotify "Inotify") (using inotify, only new deletion would trigger the trash can automation)
