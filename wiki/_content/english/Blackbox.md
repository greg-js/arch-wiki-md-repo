[Blackbox](http://blackboxwm.sourceforge.net/) is a lightweight [stacking window manager](/index.php/Window_managers#Stacking_window_managers "Window managers"). It was last updated November 3, 2005 with no plans for future releases, however its design has inspired many forks and spiritual successors.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [blackbox](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=blackbox).

To start Blackbox with [Xinitrc](/index.php/Xinitrc "Xinitrc"), use the following line:

```
exec blackbox

```

## Utilities

There are several additional packages to enhance the functionality of Blackbox (though they may also work well with other minimalist window managers):

*   [bbrun](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bbrun/) a run dialog for starting programs
*   [bbpager](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=bbpager) a pager
*   [bbkeys](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bbkeys/) configures keyboard shortcuts
