Blackbox is a lightweight stacking [window manager](/index.php/Window_manager "Window manager"). It was last updated November 3, 2005 with no plans for future releases, however its design has inspired many forks and spiritual successors.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [blackbox](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=blackbox).

To start Blackbox with [Xinitrc](/index.php/Xinitrc "Xinitrc"), use the following line:

```
exec blackbox

```
