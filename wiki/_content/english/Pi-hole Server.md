From the [Pi-hole README.md on GitHub](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole):

	The Pi-Holeâ„¢ is an advertising-aware DNS/Web server. If an ad domain is queried, a small Web page or GIF is delivered in place of the advertisement..

	The gravity.sh does most of the magic. The script pulls in ad domains from many sources and compiles them into a single list of over 1.6 million entries (if you decide to use the mahakala list). This script is controlled by the pihole command. Please run pihole -h to see what commands can be run via pihole.

For bugs, issues and general reporting, plaese refer to [pi-hole-server AUR page](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-server/).
