[The Arch Hurd Project](http://www.archhurd.org) is a port of Arch Linux to the GNU Hurd platform. It was founded on 2010-01-04 by Michael Walker (Barrucadu) and, with input from a variety of people including Allan McRae (allan), Matthias Lanzinger (melpo), and Alexander Preisinger (giselher), the project has made excellent process (as of 2010-08-24). The Hurd is [GNU](/index.php/GNU "GNU")'s quest for the perfect free software kernel and despite that, unfortunately, is quite often neglected, even by GNU developers themselves - as can be seen by the extensive number of patches on important packages (such as glibc) in the repositories. The Hurd is a microkernel running a collection of servers which implement the rest of the functionality of a Unix kernel.

Despite having no SATA, USB, PCMCIA or sound support, Arch Hurd has gained a small following of interested users and hackers, and continues to accelerate in development (a trend which may decline with the start of the next academic year).
