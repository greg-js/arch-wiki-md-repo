## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the correct dependencies:

*   [fuse2](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=fuse2) - for *vmware-vmblock-fuse*
*   [gksu](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gksu) - for root operations (memory allocations, registering license, etc.)
*   [gtkmm](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gtkmm) - for the GUI
*   [linux-headers](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux-headers)Â - for module compilation
*   [ncurses5-compat-libs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses5-compat-libs/) - needed by the `--console` installer

Download the latest [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/go/tryworkstation) or [Player](https://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer) (or a [beta](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/beta) version, if available).

Start the installation:

```
# sh VMware-*edition*-*version*.*release*.*architecture*.bundle

```

**Tip:** Some useful flags:

*   `--eulas-agreed` - Skip the EULAs
*   `--console` - Use the console UI.
*   `--custom` - Allows changing the install directory to e.g. `/usr/local` (make sure to update the `vmware-usbarbitrator.service` paths in [#systemd services](#systemd_services)).
*   `-I`, `--ignore-errors` - Ignore fatal errors.
*   `--set-setting=vmware-workstation serialNumber XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX` - Set the serial number during install (good for scripted installs).
*   `--required` - Only ask mandatory questions (results in silent install when combined with `--eulas-agreed` and `--console`).

For the `System service scripts directory`, use `/etc/init.d` (the default).

**Note:** During the installation you will get an error about `"No rc*.d style init script directories"` being given. This can be safely ignored, since Arch uses [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd").

**Tip:** To (re)build the modules from terminal later on, use:
```
# vmware-modconfig --console --install-all

```

## Configuration

### Kernel modules

VMware Workstation 12.5 supports kernels up to 4.8 out of the box.

### systemd services

*(Optional)* Instead of using `/etc/init.d/vmware` (`start|stop|status|restart`) and `/usr/bin/vmware-usbarbitrator` directly to manage the services, you may also use `.service` files (also available in the [vmware-systemd-services](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vmware-systemd-services/) package, and also included in [vmware-patch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vmware-patch/)):

 `/etc/systemd/system/vmware.service` 
```
[Unit]
Description=VMware daemon
Requires=vmware-usbarbitrator.service
Before=vmware-usbarbitrator.service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/etc/init.d/vmware start
ExecStop=/etc/init.d/vmware stop
PIDFile=/var/lock/subsys/vmware
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
 `/etc/systemd/system/vmware-usbarbitrator.service` 
```
[Unit]
Description=VMware USB Arbitrator
Requires=vmware.service
After=vmware.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vmware-usbarbitrator
ExecStop=/usr/bin/vmware-usbarbitrator --kill
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Add this service as well, if you want to connect to your VMware Workstation installation from another Workstation Server Console:

 `/etc/systemd/system/vmware-workstation-server.service` 
```
[Unit]
Description=VMware Workstation Server
Requires=vmware.service
After=vmware.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/etc/init.d/vmware-workstation-server start
ExecStop=/etc/init.d/vmware-workstation-server stop
PIDFile=/var/lock/subsys/vmware-workstation-server
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After which you can [enable](/index.php/Enable "Enable") them on boot.

#### Workstation Server service

The `vmware-workstation-server.service` calls `wssc-adminTool` in its command chain, despite having been renamed to `vmware-wssc-adminTool`.

To prevent the service startup, this can be fixed with a symlink:

```
# ln -s wssc-adminTool /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-wssc-adminTool

```

## Launching the application

To open VMware Workstation Pro:

```
$ vmware

```

or Player:

```
$ vmplayer

```

## Tips and tricks

### Entering the Workstation Pro license key

#### From terminal

```
# /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx-debug --new-sn XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX

```

Where `XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX` is your license key.

**Note:** The `-debug` binary informs the user of an incorrect license.

#### From GUI

If the above does not work, you can try:

```
# /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-enter-serial

```

### Extracting the VMware BIOS

```
$ objcopy /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx -O binary -j bios440 --set-section-flags bios440=a bios440.rom.Z
$ perl -e 'use Compress::Zlib; my $v; read STDIN, $v, '$(stat -c%s "./bios440.rom.Z")'; $v = uncompress($v); print $v;' < bios440.rom.Z > bios440.rom

```

### Extracting the installer

To view the contents of the installer `.bundle`:

```
$ sh VMware-*edition*-*version*.*release*.*architecture*.bundle --extract */tmp/vmware-bundle/*

```

#### Using the modified BIOS

If and when you decide to modify the extracted BIOS you can make your virtual machine use it by moving it to `~/vmware/*Virtual_machine_name*`:

```
$ mv bios440.rom ~/vmware/*Virtual_machine_name*/

```

then adding the name to the `*Virtual_machine_name*.vmx` file:

 `~/vmware/*Virtual_machine_name*/*Virtual_machine_name*.vmx`  `bios440.filename = "bios440.rom"` 

### Enable 3D graphics on Intel and Optimus

Some graphics drivers are blacklisted by default, due to poor and/or unstable 3D acceleration. After enabling *Accelerate 3D graphics*, the log may show something like:

```
Disabling 3D on this host due to presence of Mesa DRI driver.  Set mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = TRUE to override.

```

This means the following:

 `~/.vmware/preferences`  `mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = TRUE` 

## Troubleshooting

### /dev/vmmon not found

The full error is:

```
Could not open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory.
Please make sure that the kernel module `vmmon' is loaded.

```

This means that at least the `vmmon` module is not loaded. See the [#systemd services](#systemd_services) section for automatic loading.

### Kernel headers for version 4.x-xxxx were not found. If you installed them[...]

Install the headers ([linux-headers](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux-headers)).

**Note:** Upgrading the kernel and the headers will require you to boot to the new kernel to match the version of the headers. This is a relatively common error.

### USB devices not recognized

**Tip:** Also handled by [vmware-patch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vmware-patch/).

If not using the [systemd service](#systemd_services) to automatically handle the services, you need to manually start the `vmware-usbarbitrator` binary as root each time.

To start:

```
# vmware-usbarbitrator

```

To stop:

```
# vmware-usbarbitrator --kill

```

### The installer fails to start

If you just get back to the prompt when opening the `.bundle`, then you probably have a deprecated or broken version of the VMware installer and it should removed (you may also refer to the [uninstallation](#Uninstallation) section of this article):

```
# rm -r /etc/vmware-installer/

```

#### User interface initialization failed

You may also see an error like this:

```
 Extracting VMware Installer...done.
 No protocol specified
 No protocol specified
 User interface initialization failed.  Exiting.  Check the log for details.

```

This can be fixed by either installing the [ncurses5-compat-libs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses5-compat-libs/) dependency or temporarily allowing root access to X:

```
 $ xhost +
 $ sudo ./<vmware filename>.bundle
 $ xhost -

```

### Unable to download VMware Tools for Guests

If after [#Preventing crashes and freezes when checking for updates](#Preventing_crashes_and_freezes_when_checking_for_updates) you are still unable to download the VMware Tools ISOs, you may either try running `vmware` or `vmplayer` as *root*, or downloading them directly from the [VMware repository](http://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/).

Navigate to: "*application name* / *version* / *build ID* / linux / packages/" and download the appropriate Tools.

Extract with:

```
$ tar -xvf vmware-tools-*name*-*version*-*buildID*.x86_64.component.tar

```

And install using the VMware installer:

```
# vmware-installer --install-component=*/path/*vmware-tools-*name*-*version*-*buildID*.x86_64.component

```

If the above does not work, try installing [ncurses5-compat-libs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses5-compat-libs/).

### Incorrect login/password when trying to access VMware remotely

VMware Workstation provides the possibility to remotely manage Shared VMs through the `vmware-workstation-server` service. However, this will fail with the error `"incorrect username/password"` due to incorrect [PAM](/index.php/PAM "PAM") configuration of the `vmware-authd` service. To fix it, edit `/etc/pam.d/vmware-authd` like this:

 `/etc/pam.d/vmware-authd` 
```
#%PAM-1.0
auth     *required       pam_unix.so*
account  *required       pam_unix.so*
password *required       pam_permit.so*
session  *required       pam_unix.so*

```

and restart the `vmware` [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") service.

Now you can connect to the server with the credentials provided during the installation.

**Note:** [libxslt](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=libxslt) may be required for starting virtual machines.

### Issues with ALSA output

[To fix](http://bankimbhavsar.blogspot.co.nz/2011/09/hd-audio-in-vmware-fusion-4-and-vmware.html) sound quality issues or enabling proper HD audio output, first run:

```
$ aplay -L

```

If interested in playing 5.1 *surround sound* from the guest, look for `surround51:CARD=*vendor_name*,DEV=*num*`, if experiencing quality issues, look for `front:CARD=*vendor_name*,DEV=*num*`. Finally put the name in the `.vmx`:

 `~/vmware/*Virtual_machine_name*/*Virtual_machine_name*.vmx` 
```
sound.fileName=*"surround51:CARD=Live,DEV=0"*
sound.autodetect=*"FALSE"*
```

[OSS emulation](/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#User-space_utilities "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture") should also be disabled.

### Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is running

To disable `KVM` on boot, you can use something like:

 `/etc/modprobe.d/vmware.conf` 
```
blacklist kvm
blacklist kvm-amd   # For AMD CPUs
blacklist kvm-intel # For Intel CPUs

```

### Segmentation fault at startup due to old Intel microcode

Old Intel microcode may result in the following kind of segmentation fault at startup:

```
/usr/bin/vmware: line 31: 4941 Segmentation fault "$BINDIR"/vmware-modconfig --appname="VMware Workstation" --icon="vmware-workstation"

```

See [Microcode](/index.php/Microcode "Microcode") for how to update the microcode.

### Guests have incorrect system clocks or are unable to boot: "[...]timeTracker_user.c:234 bugNr=148722"

This is due to [incomplete](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?cmd=displayKC&externalId=1591) support of power management features ([Intel SpeedStep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_speedstep "wikipedia:Intel speedstep") and [AMD PowerNow!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_powernow "wikipedia:AMD powernow")/[Cool'n'Quiet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool%27n%27Quiet "wikipedia:Cool'n'Quiet")) in VMware Linux that vary the CPU frequency. In March 2012, with the release of [linux 3.3-1](https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/trunk/config.x86_64?h=packages/linux&id=9abe018d91a5d8c3af7523d30b8aa73f86b680be) the maximum frequency [Performance](/index.php/CPU_frequency_governors "CPU frequency governors") governor was replaced with the dynamic *Ondemand*. When the host CPU frequency changes, the Guest system clock runs too quickly or too slowly, but may also render the whole Guest unbootable.

To prevent this, the maximum host CPU frequency can be specified, and [Time Stamp Counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter "wikipedia:Time Stamp Counter") (TSC) disabled, in the global configuration:

 `/etc/vmware/config` 
```
host.cpukHz = "X"  # The maximum speed in KHz, e.g. 3GHz is "3000000".
host.noTSC = "TRUE" # Keep the Guest system clock accurate even when
ptsc.noTSC = "TRUE" # the time stamp counter (TSC) is slow.
```

**Tip:** To periodically correct the time (once per minute), in the *Options* tab of VMware Tools, enable: *"Time synchronization between the virtual machine and the host operating system"*.

### Networking on Guests not available after system restart

This is likely due to the `vmnet` module not being loaded [[1]](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/could-not-connect-ethernet0-to-virtual-network-dev-vmnet8-796095/). See also the [#systemd services](#systemd_services) section for automatic loading.

### Kernel modules fail to build after Linux 4.9

As of VMware Workstation Pro 12.5.2, the module source needs to be modified to be successfully compiled under kernel 4.9 [[2]](http://rglinuxtech.com/?p=1847).

```
# cd /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source
# tar xf vmmon.tar
# mv vmmon.tar vmmon.old.tar
# sed -i 's/uvAddr, numPages, 0, 0/uvAddr, numPages, 0/g' vmmon-only/linux/hostif.c
# tar cf vmmon.tar vmmon-only
# rm -r vmmon-only

```

```
# tar xf vmnet.tar
# mv vmnet.tar vmnet.old.tar
# sed -i 's/addr, 1, 1, 0/addr, 1, 0/g' vmnet-only/userif.c
# tar cf vmnet.tar vmnet-only
# rm -r vmnet-only

```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall VMware you need the product name (either `vmware-workstation` or `vmware-player`). To list all the installed products:

```
$ vmware-installer -l

```

and uninstall with (`--required`Â skips the confirmation):

```
# vmware-installer -u *product* --required

```

**Tip:** Use `--console` for the console UI.

Remember to also [disable](/index.php/Disable "Disable") and remove the services:

```
# rm /etc/systemd/system/vmware.service
# rm /etc/systemd/system/vmware-usbarbitrator.service

```

You may also want to have a look at the module directories in `/usr/lib/modules/*kernel_name*/misc/` for any leftovers.
