[**0 A.D.**](https://play0ad.com/) is a free and open-source, cross-platform (supporting Linux, macOS and Windows NT) real-time strategy (RTS) game. In it the user is made the leader of an ancient civilization, and as such must gather the necessary resources to beat competing military forces. It is similar to Age of Empires, and was originally a mod for Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, since then it has evolved into a standalone game, with its own game engine, pyrogenesis. 0 A.D. is written in C++ and it is presently in alpha development, so there are no "stable" releases yet available. 0 A.D.'s source code is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and its artwork is licensed under the CC-BY-SA license.
