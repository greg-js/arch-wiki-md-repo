# Project Leader

## Roles

The Arch Linux Leader will have the following roles:

### Decision Making

The Leader will serve to make decisions on any aspect of the distribution that fails to reach consensus on the mailing lists. Here consensus is defined by the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by the concerned parties and by a process that involves seeking to take into account the views of all parties concerned and to reconcile any conflicting arguments. Consensus does not imply unanimity. A clear and concise description of the competing options will be provided to the leader by a single representative of each viewpoint prior to decisions being made, to ensure the Leader is well informed prior to decision making.

### Financial

The Leader serves as the Arch Linux representative on the SPI, and approves all spending from the Arch Linux account. The Leader will inform the team yearly (to coincide with the release of the SPI report) on the status of Arch Linux finances.

### Legal

The leader is the Arch Linux representative in all legal matters. The primary responsibility of the Leader in this role is holding the Arch Linux Trademark. They will be in charge of handling trademark requests and related issues.

### Project Management

The Leader oversee the progress of projects with distribution-wide effect. Regular census of planned and on-going projects will be performed, with action taken to ensure these projects run to completion, whether to full implementation or making a decision regarding abandonment.

## Election

The role of Arch Linux Leader is determined by a vote among eligible members of the Arch Linux Team.

### Nomination

Nomination of candidates will take place in a two week period prior to voting. Nominations require support of two members of the Arch Linux Team, which may include the nominee. If the nominee is neither of the nominators, then they must also agree to be nominated. All Team members are eligible for nomination.

### Voting

When more than two candidates are nominated, voting will be conducted using the [Instant-runoff Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) system. Ballots with candidates ranked in order of preference will be collected and tallied a member of the Team who is neither a candidate, nor has nominated a candidate. Voting shall take place over a two week period, with no quorum in effect.

Team members eligible for voting are:

*   Arch Linux Developers
*   Arch Linux Trusted Users
*   Arch Linux Support Staff

The complete list of individuals in these roles is defined on the Arch Linux website, fixed at the beginning of the voting period. People who have roles in multiple of these categories are only eligible to vote once.

### Triggering of Elections

The election of the Arch Linux Leader can triggered by any of the following conditions:

*   The Leader reaches the end of their term (defined below),
*   The Leader dies,
*   The Leader calls for an early election,
*   The Leader resigns, or
*   A vote is successfully held to remove the Leader from their position.

A successful vote for removal of a leader must satisfy the following conditions:

*   A two-thirds majority is achieved in favour of removal
*   A quorum of 50% of eligible voters (as defined above) is achieved
