## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [busybox](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=busybox) package.

Busybox commands are symbolic links to `/usr/bin/busybox` and thus take very little space. This is especially interesting for low-footprint systems.

## Usage

### init

[Minirc](/index.php/Minirc "Minirc") provides an init script compatible to busybox-init. See [init](/index.php/Init "Init") for details.

### mdev

See [Gentoo wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Mdev).
