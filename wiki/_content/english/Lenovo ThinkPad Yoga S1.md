## Overview

This Page is a work in progress

The hardware and firmware supports both [UEFI](/index.php/UEFI "UEFI") and BIOS (mentioned as "Legacy" in firmware). It comes preinstalled with Windows in UEFI mode, so the [EFI system partition](/index.php/EFI_system_partition "EFI system partition") is already there. By default the HDD/SSD should be using [GPT](/index.php/GPT "GPT").
