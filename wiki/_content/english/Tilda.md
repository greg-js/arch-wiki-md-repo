[Tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda/) is a "pop-up virtual terminal" for X, just like [Yakuake](/index.php/Yakuake "Yakuake") ([KDE](/index.php/KDE "KDE")) or [Guake](/index.php/Guake "Guake") ([GNOME](/index.php/GNOME "GNOME")), but a little more lightweight and a little more maintained than sjterm.

## Why Tilda

You may find it very convenient to drop into a shell quickly without wasting screen estate. Tilda allows you to do that, as it is already open and therefore can be accessed very quickly, while staying unobtrusively in the "background" when you do not need it.

## Installation

[tilda](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=tilda) is available in the [community] repository.

***Tilda is not compatible with Wayland*** see: [Github](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda/issues/150)

## Using with dwm

[dwm](/index.php/Dwm "Dwm") is a tiling [window manager](/index.php/Window_manager "Window manager"), which manages placement of windows automatically, so it takes some configuration to make Tilda work properly.

You have to edit dwm's `config.h` and recompile/reinstall dwm to properly account for Tilda.

Get the latest [PKGBUILD](/index.php/PKGBUILD "PKGBUILD") for dwm:

```
# abs community/dwm

```

Copy newest sources to your working directory, I am using `~/sources`:

```
$ cp -r /var/abs/community/dwm ~/sources

```

Get into working directory to start config:

```
$ cd ~/sources/dwm

```

Edit config.h:

```
static const Rule rules[] = {
	/* class      instance    title       tags mask     isfloating   monitor */
	{ "Gimp",     NULL,       NULL,       0,            True,        -1 },
	{ "Firefox",  NULL,       NULL,       1 << 8,       False,       -1 },
//add the line below
	{ "Tilda",  NULL,       NULL,       0,       True,       -1 },
	{ "Volumeicon",  NULL,       NULL,       0,       True,       -1 },
};
```

The above makes all windows with the WM_CLASS "Tilda" floating. The word "Tilda" has to be uppercase, as shown by

```
$ xprop |grep WM_CLASS

```

Save `config.h`, then compile and install dwm:

```
$ makepkg -g >> PKGBUILD && makepkg -efi

```

Start dwm or restart dwm if it is already active, either by MOD+SHIFT+Q or killing dwm and restarting it.

Launch tilda with -C option:

```
$ tilda -C

```

Now you can configure Tilda, I recommend the following options:

```
Font: Clean 9
Appearance: Height: 50%, Width: 70%, Centered Horizontally
Extras: Enable Transparency Level 15
Animated Pulldown: 1500 usec, Orientation: Top
Colors: Built-in Scheme "Green on Black"
Scrolling: Scrollbar is on the left, 2000 lines scrollback
Key Binding: F9

```

Here is what my config looks like after those settings in `~/.config/tilda/config_0`:

```
tilda_config_version = "0.9.6"
# image = ""
# command = ""
font = "Clean 9"
key = "F9"
title = "Tilda"
background_color = "white"
# working_dir = ""
web_browser = "firefox"
lines = 2000
max_width = 956
max_height = 384
min_width = 1
min_height = 1
transparency = 15
x_pos = 205
y_pos = 1
tab_pos = 0
backspace_key = 0
delete_key = 1
d_set_title = 3
command_exit = 2
scheme = 1
slide_sleep_usec = 1500
animation_orientation = 0
scrollbar_pos = 0
back_red = 0
back_green = 0
back_blue = 0
text_red = 0
text_green = 65535
text_blue = 0
scroll_background = true
scroll_on_output = false
notebook_border = false
antialias = true
scrollbar = false
use_image = false
grab_focus = true
above = true
notaskbar = true
bold = true
blinks = true
scroll_on_key = true
bell = false
run_command = false
pinned = true
animation = true
hidden = true
centered_horizontally = true
centered_vertically = false
enable_transparency = true
double_buffer = false

```

It is important you enable the pulldown-animation, otherwise Tilda will keep jumping down each time you unhide it, must be a dwm issue.
