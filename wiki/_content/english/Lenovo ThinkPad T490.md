## BIOS

### BIOS configurations

*   `Config -> Thunderbolt BIOS Assist Mode - Set to "Enabled"`. This setting is recommended for Linux.

## FN Keys

Most FN keys should work out of the box, but if it doesn't, bind mentioned keys to below commands:

*   **F1** button: `amixer set Master toggle`.
*   **F2** button: `amixer set Master 5%-`.
*   **F3** button: `amixer set Master 5%+`.
*   **F4** button: `amixer set Capture toggle`.

## Touchpad

Touchpad is problematic. By default, if you hold the thumb over the button area, the pointer will not move. Once the system is installed, the problem disappears when using KDE, while GNOME still exhibits the issue. In GNOME, use the following to fix the problem:

```
xinput set-prop 'SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad' 'libinput Click Method Enabled' 1 0

```

Even after doing this, the mouse pointer still jumps around when clicking the button sometimes.

## Fingerprint Sensor

Fingerprint sensor seems to work with some recent firmware and software updates (2019-12-15). Driver development info: [[1]](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/vincenth/libfprint/tree/synaptics-driver-20190617)[[2]](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/issues/181).

1\. Use [fwupd](/index.php/Fwupd "Fwupd") to install the latest firmware for "Synaptics Prometheus Fingerprint Reader". The update might have to be done manually (the released firmware is in testing). [[3]](https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devices/com.synaptics.prometheus.firmware)[[4]](https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devices/com.synaptics.prometheus.config)

2\. Latest fprintd and libfprint are required[[5]](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/). [fprintd-libfprint2](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fprintd-libfprint2/) and [libfprint-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libfprint-git/) can be useful here.

3\. [fprint](/index.php/Fprint "Fprint") has more details on how to setup the fingerprint for [PAM](/index.php/PAM "PAM") authentication for example.

## Known Issues

### CPU throttling issue

With the BIOS Version 1.52 (this problem is known to occur on 1.52, it might still happen on other versions too), the CPU tends to throttle down to 400 MHz earlier than it should. In particular, this can be seen when using [Bumblebee](/index.php/Bumblebee "Bumblebee").

After installing BIOS Version 1.54, this problem is fixed.

### Speaker noise issue

The speaker on the Lenovo Thinkpad T490 may have a high static hissing noise, which doesn't change if you lower the volume, but stops if you mute the speaker or use the headphone jack. This problem can't be fixed completely as of now. Updating to the most current BIOS version will make the speaker silent while it's not playing anything without you having to mute it all the time. But as soon as the user is playing sound, the noise will be back, clearly audible in the background.

Check the [Lenovo Support Website](https://support.lenovo.com/) for the newest BIOS Version.

### MicroSD card reader issue

The MicroSD card reader works with the arch kernel 5.3.11-arch1-1\. There have been issues [with previous kernel](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Lenovo_ThinkPad_T490&oldid=588258#MicroSD_card_reader_issue) versions.

### Bluetooth

Pairing with a bluetooth speaker and the initial connect works. Connecting to an already paired device currently fails (e.g. after a reboot). Furthermore an error message is shown in the kernel log:

```
[ 3183.282938] debugfs: File 'le_min_key_size' in directory 'hci0' already present!
[ 3183.282950] debugfs: File 'le_max_key_size' in directory 'hci0' already present!

```

An issue for this already exists on the kernel bugtracker [[6]](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204765). It is not clear whether this relates to the connection problem.

### Slow wakeup after suspend

After suspend the laptop takes a few second until it becomes responsive. Disallowing the access to the [WWAN](/index.php/ThinkPad_mobile_Internet "ThinkPad mobile Internet") device in the BIOS solves this issue.

## ACPI

The default `/etc/acpi/handler.sh` script has a check for the device that looks like this:

```
ac_adapter)
        case "$2" in
            AC|ACAD|ADP0)

```

This will not work, since the T490 device is called `ACPI0003` which is not matched by the above check. The instructions in [Acpid](/index.php/Acpid "Acpid") does mention a pattern that does work and it is recommended to use this instead.
