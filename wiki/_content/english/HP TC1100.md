## Booting

Since the tablet has no internal cd-rom, booting from USB is the only option for getting into the installation media.

### USB Key

**Note:** I was unable to get the tablet to boot from a USB key. Use USB CD-Rom if posible

### USB CD/DVD Rom

1.  Plugin a USB CD-Rom drive with installation disk
2.  Attach keyboard (USB or Dock are fine)
3.  Boot computer
4.  While in BIOS post screen, press the "jog-dial" located on the top left edge
5.  Select "CD-Rom" and press jog-dial again

## Post Install

For additional tablet related information, please read the [Tablet PC](/index.php/Tablet_PC "Tablet PC") page.

### Graphics

[Nouveau](/index.php/Nouveau "Nouveau") works fine, including the 3D support

### Power

Install and setup the following

*   [Cpufreq](/index.php/Cpufreq "Cpufreq")
*   [ACPI hotkeys](/index.php/ACPI_hotkeys "ACPI hotkeys") (acpi and acpid for suspend button to work)

#### Suspending and Resuming

See [Power management/Suspend and hibernate](/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate "Power management/Suspend and hibernate").

Resuming after suspending to disk causes the stylus to cease functioning. No data will be sent by the digitizer until it receives the `ISDV4_SAMPLING` command, which is merely the ASCII character "1" (49). Unfortunately, the [xf86-input-wacom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-wacom) driver only sends that particular command during initialization. I suppose the proper way to fix this would be to modify the driver to recognize when it's resuming from a suspend to disk and send the command accordingly. As a workaround, run the `xset -display :0 q 2>&1 | head -1 | grep -Eqx 'No protocol specified|Keyboard Control:' && printf 1 >>/dev/ttyS0` (it requires [xorg-xset](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xorg-xset)).

### Stylus

Install the [xf86-input-wacom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-wacom) package. A reboot may be required for Xorg to recognize the serial digitizer For additional help, see the [Wacom](/index.php/Wacom "Wacom") page.

### Stylus Buttons

I've done a [quick and dirty hack](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B1SyqFJr-62rMXhPWUo2VVBYY28) of [xf86-input-wacom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-wacom) to get the stylus-activated buttons working.

Unpack it, build it using [makepkg](/index.php/Makepkg "Makepkg"), and install the resulting package with [pacman](/index.php/Pacman "Pacman"). The stylus buttons will now generate keycodes when triggered, and these can be bound to actions by either your [window manager](/index.php/Window_manager "Window manager") or [xbindkeys](/index.php/Xbindkeys "Xbindkeys"). The specific keycodes are as follows:

| Button | Keycode |
| Rotate | KEY_DIRECTION (161) |
| Journal Launch | KEY_PROG3 (210) |
| Tablet PC Input Panel Launch | KEY_PROG4 (211) |

### Right Hand Buttons

Side buttons work out of the box. Sometimes they do not respond until the unit is put into standby and then resumed
