## History

**ArchMap** was originally created by [xterminus](/index.php/User:Xterminus "User:Xterminus"). He created jpeg files that could be downloaded from this page. However, he didn't have the time to maintain them anymore, so he dropped the project.

When Google Earth for Linux was released, [brain0](/index.php/User:Brain0 "User:Brain0") recreated the project.

The third version of ArchMap was based on Google Maps.

The current version was started by [alux](/index.php/User:Alux "User:Alux") with help from [kyrias](/index.php/User:Kyrias "User:Kyrias") and [fsckd](/index.php/User:Fsckd "User:Fsckd").

## archmap

`[archmap](https://github.com/maelstrom59/ArchMap/blob/master/archmap.py)` is a python script that can generate *GeoJSON*, *KML* and *CSV* files by parsing [this list](/index.php/ArchMap/List#List "ArchMap/List") of Arch Linux users.

**Note:** ArchMap is currently under development on [GitHub](https://github.com/maelstrom59/ArchMap). If you have any suggestions, please [post them](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=22518&p=2) in the forums or [create an issue](https://github.com/maelstrom59/ArchMap/issues) in the repository.

The documentation is hosted by [readthedocs.org](http://archmap.readthedocs.io).

## Maps

[Arch Women](https://archwomen.org/wiki/aw-tech:archmap) host pre-generated *[GeoJSON](https://archwomen.org/media/archmap/archmap.geojson)*, *[KML](https://archwomen.org/media/archmap/archmap.kml)* and *[CSV](https://archwomen.org/media/archmap/archmap.csv)* files that are made by `archmap`, these files are updated daily and are used to make the maps below.

### OpenStreetMap

geojson.io is *"a fast, simple tool to create, change, and publish maps"*, it uses OpenStreetMap as a base-layer. [This link](http://geojson.io/#data=data:text/x-url,https://archwomen.org/media/archmap/archmap.geojson) will pull the *GeoJSON* file from the Arch Women server and open it up for editing on the site.

Some other renderings of the data are hosted by [CartoDB](https://alux.cartodb.com/viz/c1cd0e2a-5af7-11e4-afcd-0e9d821ea90d/embed_map) and [MapBox](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/alux.hclg4eg0/page.html?secure=1#4/39.63/-104.91). However, these may be out of date as they have to be updated manually by [alux](/index.php/User:Alux "User:Alux") importing the *GeoJSON* file.

### Google Earth

You can add the coordinates to Google Earth permanently:

*   Right click on *My Places*
*   Go to *Add* -> *Network Link*
*   Enter "ArchMap" into the *Name* field and put `[https://archwomen.org/media/archmap/archmap.kml](https://archwomen.org/media/archmap/archmap.kml)` into the *Link* field, then press *OK*.

You can refresh the data by right-clicking the ArchMap folder and selecting *Refresh*.

### Daily updated map

[This map](https://data.dopsi.ch/archmap) is updated daily (around 10:00am UTC) using the [ArchMap](http://github.com/maelstrom59/ArchMap) script. The KML data used to render the map is available [here](https://data.dopsi.ch/archmap/archmap.kml), the raw users list [here](https://data.dopsi.ch/archmap/users.txt).
