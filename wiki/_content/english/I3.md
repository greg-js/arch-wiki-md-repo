[i3](http://i3wm.org/) is a dynamic [tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager "wikipedia:Tiling window manager") inspired by [wmii](/index.php/Wmii "Wmii") that is primarily targeted at developers and advanced users.

The stated goals for i3 include clear documentation, proper multi-monitor support, a tree structure for windows, and different modes like in [vim](/index.php/Vim "Vim").

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [i3](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/i3/) [package group](/index.php/Pacman#Installing_package_groups "Pacman"). It includes the window manager [i3-wm](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=i3-wm), [i3status](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=i3status) which writes a status line to i3bar through [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29 "wikipedia:Standard streams"), and [i3lock](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=i3lock), a screen locker.

Additional packages are available in the [Arch User Repository](/index.php/Arch_User_Repository "Arch User Repository"). See the section [#Patches](#Patches) for examples.

### Display manager

[i3-wm](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=i3-wm) includes `i3.desktop` as [Xsession](/index.php/Xsession "Xsession") which starts the window manager. `i3-with-shmlog.desktop` enables logs (useful for debugging). [i3-gnome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3-gnome/) integrates `i3` into [GNOME](/index.php/GNOME "GNOME").

### xinitrc

Edit [Xinitrc](/index.php/Xinitrc "Xinitrc"), and add:

```
exec i3

```

To log the output from i3, add this line instead:

```
exec i3 -V >> ~/i3log-$(date +'%F-%k-%M-%S') 2>&1

```

If you have trouble mapping keys (e.g. `;` as semicolon), use [xorg-xev](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xorg-xev) or see [Extra keyboard keys](/index.php/Extra_keyboard_keys "Extra keyboard keys").

```
$ xev | grep -A2 --line-buffered '^KeyRelease' | sed -n '/keycode /s/^.*keycode \([0-9]*\).* (.*, \(.*\)).*$/\1 \2/p'

```

## Usage

See the [official documentation](http://i3wm.org/docs) for more information, namely the [i3 User’s Guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html).

### Application launcher

i3 uses [dmenu](/index.php/Dmenu "Dmenu") as an application launcher, which is bound by default to `$mod+d`. As an alternative, one can use [dmenu2](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dmenu2/) from the AUR which has many more features including transparency and support for xft fonts.

[i3-wm](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=i3-wm) contains *i3-dmenu-desktop*, a [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "wikipedia:Perl") wrapper for *dmenu* which uses [desktop entries](/index.php/Desktop_entries "Desktop entries") to create a list of all installed applications. Alternatively, the package [j4-dmenu-desktop-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/j4-dmenu-desktop-git/) can be used; it is a near-drop-in replacement for *i3-dmenu-desktop*, but much faster[[1](https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop/blob/master/README.md)].

### Keybindings

In i3, commands are invoked with a modifier key, referred to as `$mod`. This is `Alt` (Mod1) by default, with `Super` (Mod4) being a popular alternative. Super is the key usually represented on a keyboard as a Windows icon, or on an Apple keyboard as a Command key.

See the [i3 reference card](http://i3wm.org/docs/refcard.html) and [Using i3](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_using_i3) for the defaults. See [Keyboard bindings](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings) to add new shortcuts.

### Containers

i3 manages windows in a tree structure, with containers as building blocks. This structure branches with horizontal or vertical splits. Containers are tiled by default, but can be set to tabbed or stacked layouts, as well as made floating (such as for dialog windows). Floating windows are always on top.

See [i3 Tree](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_tree) and [Containers and the tree data structure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWA8Pl57UBY) for details.

## Configuration

See [Configuring i3](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#configuring) for details. The rest of this article assumes the *i3* configuration file to be in the folder `~/.config` (contrary to *i3-config-wizard*, which creates `~/.i3/config`).

### Configuration wizard and alternative keyboard layouts

When *i3* is first started, it offers to run the configuration wizard *i3-config-wizard*. This tool creates `~/.i3/config` by rewriting a template configuration file in `/etc/i3/config.keycodes`. It makes two kinds of modifications to the default template:

1.  It asks the user to choose a default modifier key, which it adds to the template as a single line, like `set $mod Mod1`; and
2.  it replaces all *bindcode* lines with *bindsym* lines corresponding to the user's current keyboard layout.

Part 2 is designed to ensure that the four navigation shortcuts, `j`, `k`, `l` and "semicolon" on a Qwerty keyboard, will be mapped to keysyms which have the same location, e.g. `h`, `t`, `n`, `s` on a Dvorak keyboard. The side-effect of this magic is that up to fifteen other keysyms may be remapped, often with confusing results - so that, for a Dvorak user, "restart" is bound to `$mod1+p` instead of `$mod1+r`, "split horizontally" is bound to `$mod1+d` instead of `$mod1+h`, and so on.

Therefore, users of alternate keyboard layouts who want key bindings with easy mnemonics, and which match the bindings given in tutorials, may prefer to just copy `/etc/i3/config` into `~/.config/i3/config` (or `~/.i3/config`) and start by editing that file, rather than using the config wizard.

Note that a keycode-based configuration is also possible, e.g. for users who often switch between keyboard layouts, but want the i3 bindings to stay the same.

### Colorschemes

The configuration file allows for customization of window decoration colors, but the syntax makes it impractical to create or share themes. There are several projects which make this easier and include a variety of user-contributed themes.

*   **i3-style** — Modifies your config in place from a theme stored in a JSON object, designed for frequently tweaking or changing a colorscheme

	[https://github.com/acrisci/i3-style](https://github.com/acrisci/i3-style) || [nodejs-i3-style](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-i3-style/)

*   **j4-make-config** — Merge your config with a collection of themes or personal config parts, for example host-specific configuration, allowing quick changing of the theme and flexible, dynamic customization of the configuration

	[https://github.com/okraits/j4-make-config](https://github.com/okraits/j4-make-config) || [j4-make-config-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/j4-make-config-git/)

### i3bar

In addition to showing workspace information, i3bar can act as an input for i3status or an alternative, such as those mentioned in the next section. For example:

 `~/.config/i3/config` 
```
bar {
    output            LVDS1
    status_command    i3status
    position          top
    mode              hide
    workspace_buttons yes
    tray_output       none

    font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1

    colors {
        background #000000
        statusline #ffffff

        focused_workspace  #ffffff #285577
        active_workspace   #ffffff #333333
        inactive_workspace #888888 #222222
        urgent_workspace   #ffffff #900000
    }
}
```

See the [Configuring i3bar](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_configuring_i3bar) for details.

#### i3bar alternatives

Some users may prefer panels such as those provided by conventional [Desktop Environments](/index.php/Desktop_environment "Desktop environment"). This can be achieved within i3 by launching the panel application of choice during startup.

For the [XFCE panel](/index.php/Xfce#Panel "Xfce"), add the following line anywhere in `~/.config/i3/config`:

```
exec --no-startup-id xfce4-panel --disable-wm-check

```

**Note:** Panel features that are specific to the [Desktop environment](/index.php/Desktop_environment "Desktop environment") (e.g., widgets for managing workspaces/sessions) will most likely not work, though i3's functionality should remain unaffected.

i3bar can be disabled by commenting out the `bar{ }` section of `~/.config/i3/config` or using:

 `~/.config/i3/config` 
```
# bar toggle, hide or show 
bindsym $mod+m bar mode toggle

```

This way you can show or hide bar as you want.

### i3status

Copy over the default configuration files to the home directory:

```
$ cp /etc/i3status.conf ~/.config/i3status/config

```

Not all plugins are defined in the default configuration and some configuration values may be invalid for your system, so the need to be updated accordingly. See `man i3status` for details.

#### i3status replacements

	[https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status) || [py3status](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/py3status/)

#### Iconic fonts in the status bar

*i3bar* can be [patched](#Patches) for XBM icon support, but you can use iconic font sets instead.

*   **ttf-font-awesome** — Scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS. A [cheatsheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/) shows the Unicode point for each glyph.

	[http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) || [ttf-font-awesome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-font-awesome/)

*   **ttf-font-icons** — Non-overlapping and consistently sized mix of Awesome and Ionicons. This also avoids minor overlapping between DejaVu Sans and Awesome.

	[https://www.dropbox.com/s/9iysh2i0gadi4ic/icons.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9iysh2i0gadi4ic/icons.pdf) || [ttf-font-icons](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-font-icons/).

To combine fonts, define a font fallback sequence in your configuration file, separating fonts with `,` like so:

 `~/.config/i3/config` 
```
bar {
  ...
  font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono, Icons 8
  ...
}
```

In accordance with [pango syntax](https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/pango-Fonts.html#pango-font-description-from-string), font size is specified only once, at the end of the comma-separated list of font families. Setting a size for each font would cause all but the last font to be ignored.

Add icons to the format strings in `~/.config/i3status/config` using the unicode numbers given in the cheatsheets linked above. The input method will vary between text editors. For instance, to insert the "heart" icon (unicode number f004):

*   in various gui text editors (e.g. [gedit](/index.php/Gedit "Gedit"), Leafpad) and terminals (e.g. GNOME Terminal, xfce4-terminal): `ctrl+shift+u`, `f004`, `Enter`
*   in [Emacs](/index.php/Emacs "Emacs"): `ctrl+x`, `8`, `Enter`, `f004`, `Enter`
*   in [Vim](/index.php/Vim "Vim") (while in insert mode): `Ctrl+v`, `uf004`
*   in [urxvt](/index.php/Urxvt "Urxvt"): while holding `Ctrl+Shift`, type `f004`

### Terminal emulator

By default when pressing `$mod+Return` it launches the `i3-sensible-terminal` which is a script that invokes a terminal. See `man i3-sensible-terminal` for the order terminals are invoked in.

To instead launch a terminal of choice, modify this line in `~/.config/i3/config`:

```
bindsym $mod+Return exec i3-sensible-terminal

```

Alternatively, [locally define](/index.php/Environment_variable#Per_user "Environment variable") the `$TERMINAL` variable:

```
$ export TERMINAL=*yourterminal*

```

### Jump to urgent window

Add to `.i3/config`: [[4]](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/853/how-to-jump-to-urgent-workspace/)

```
bindsym $mod+x [urgent=latest] focus

```

### Save and restore the window layout

From version 4.8, and onward *i3* can save and restore workspace layouts. To do this, the following packages are needed: [perl-anyevent-i3](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=perl-anyevent-i3) and [perl-json-xs](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=perl-json-xs) from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

**Note:** This section only provides quick tutorial on how to save the current window layout of a single workspace and how to restore it for later use. Refer to the [official documentation](http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) for more details

#### Save the current window layout of a single workspace

To save the current window layout, follow these steps:

1.  First, execute various commands to open windows in a preferred workspace and resize them if needed. Make sure to write down each executed command for each window.
2.  Now, in a new workspace, open a terminal and run the following: `i3-save-tree --workspace N > ~/.i3/workspace_N.json` where N is the number of the preferred workspace. This will save the current layout of workspace N to the file `~/.i3/workspace_N.json`.
3.  The newly created file needs to be edited, however this may be done with the following commands: `tail -n +2 ~/.i3/workspace_N.json | fgrep -v '// splitv' | sed 's|//||g' > ~/.i3/workspace_N.json` 

#### Restore the window layout of the workspace

There are two ways to restore the layout of the workspace: by writing a script, or by editing `~/.i3/config` to automatically load the layout. In this section only the first case will be considered, refer to the [official documentation](http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html#_restoring_the_layout) for the second case.

To restore the saved layout in the previous section, write a file named `load_layout.sh` with the following contents:

*   The starting lines:

 `~/load_layout.sh` 
```
#!/bin/bash
i3-msg "workspace M; append_layout ~/.i3/workspace_N.json"
```

where M is the number of the workspace in which you would like to load the previously saved layout and N is the number of workspace saved in the previous section.

*   And the commands used in the previous section to get the preferred windows, but enclosed in parentheses and with an ampersand appended before the last parentheses.

For example, if the saved layout contained three `uxterm` windows:

 `~/load_layout.sh` 
```
#!/bin/bash

# First we append the saved layout of worspace N to workspace M
i3-msg "workspace M; append_layout ~/.i3/workspace_N.json"

# And finally we fill the containers with the programs they had
(uxterm &)
(uxterm &)
(uxterm &)
```

Then set the file as executable:

```
chmod u+x ~/load_layout.sh

```

And finally, the layout of worskpace N can be loaded onto to workspace M by running:

```
~/load_layout.sh

```

**Tip:** Adding `bindsym $mod+g exec ~/load_layout.sh` to `~/.i3/config` and restarting i3 will bind Mod+g to run the above script.

**Note:** If the above script does not work properly, refer to the [official documentation](http://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html#_editing_layout_files). The *swallows* sections of `~/.i3/workspace_N.json` needs to be manually edited.

### Scratchpad containers

By default, [scratchpads](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_scratchpad) only contain a single window. However, containers can also be made a scratchpad.

Create a new container (for example, `Mod+Enter`), split it (`Mod+v`) and create another container. Focus the parent (`Mod+a`), split in the opposite direction (`Mod+h`), and create again.

Focus the first container (with focus parent as needed), make the window floating (`Mod+Shift+Space`), and move it to the scratchpad (`Mod+Shift+-`). You can now split containers to preference.

**Note:** Containers cannot be resized individually in floating windows. Resize the containers before making windows floating.

**Tip:** When only using terminal applications, consider a multiplexer such as [tmux](/index.php/Tmux "Tmux") instead.

See also [[5]](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/138/multiple-scratchpad/i3) for multiple scratchpads.

### Screensaver and power management

With [Power_management#xss-lock](/index.php/Power_management#xss-lock "Power management") you can register a screenlocker for your i3 session.

Alternatively, *xautolock* can lock the screen after awakening from sleep or hibernation with the `-lockaftersleep` option. The `-time` option locks the screen after a given time period.

```
xautolock -time 10 -locker "i3lock -i 'background_image.png'" -lockaftersleep &

```

See also [DPMS](/index.php/DPMS "DPMS").

### Shutdown, reboot, lock screen

Key combinations for shutdown, reboot and screenlock can be added to `~/.config/i3/config`. The below example assumes you have [polkit](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=polkit) installed to allow unprivileged users to run [power management](/index.php/Systemd#Power_management "Systemd") commands.

```
set $Locker i3lock && sleep 1

set $mode_system System (l) lock, (e) logout, (s) suspend, (h) hibernate, (r) reboot, (Shift+s) shutdown
mode "$mode_system" {
    bindsym l exec --no-startup-id $Locker, mode "default"
    bindsym e exec --no-startup-id i3-msg exit, mode "default"
    bindsym s exec --no-startup-id $Locker && systemctl suspend, mode "default"
    bindsym h exec --no-startup-id $Locker && systemctl hibernate, mode "default"
    bindsym r exec --no-startup-id systemctl reboot, mode "default"
    bindsym Shift+s exec --no-startup-id systemctl poweroff -i, mode "default"  

    # back to normal: Enter or Escape
    bindsym Return mode "default"
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
}

bindsym $mod+Pause mode "$mode_system"

```

Once completed, you will be presented with a prompt whenever you press `$mod+pause`. For more complex behaviour, use a separate script, and refer to it in the mode. [[6]](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c8cd0a59bf4acb273068)

**Note:**

*   `sleep 1` adds a small delay to prevent possible race conditions with suspend [[7]](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-2d/+bug/830348)
*   The `-i` argument for `systemctl poweroff` causes a shutdown even if other users are logged-in (this requires [polkit](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=polkit)), or when *logind* (wrongly) assumes so. [[8]](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62676)

For a list of alternative screen lockers, see [List of applications/Security#Screen lockers](/index.php/List_of_applications/Security#Screen_lockers "List of applications/Security").

### Tabbed or stacked web-browsing

Some web-browsers intentionally do not implement tabs, since managing tabs is considered to be the task of the window manager, not the task of the browser.

To let i3 manage your tab-less web-browser, in this example for [uzbl](/index.php/Uzbl "Uzbl"), add the following line to your `~/.config/i3/config`

```
for_window [class="Uzbl-core"] focus child, layout stacking, focus

```

This is for stacked web browsing, meaning that the windows will be shown vertically. The advantage over tabbed browsing is that the window-titles are fully visible, even if a lot of browser windows are open.

If you prefer tabbed browsing, with windows in horizontal direction ('tabs'), use

```
for_window [class="Uzbl-core"] focus child, layout tabbed, focus

```

### Workspace variables

As workspaces are defined multiple times in i3, assigning workspace variables can be helpful. For example [[9]](https://github.com/dkeg/bloat2.0/blob/master/i3config#L55):

```
set $WS1 term
set $WS2 web
set $WS3 misc
set $WS4 media
set $WS5 code

```

Then replace workspace names with their matching variables:

```
bindsym $mod+1          workspace $WS1
...
bindsym $mod+Shift+1    move container to workspace $WS1

```

See [Changing named workspaces](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_named_workspaces_moving_to_workspaces) for more information.

### Correct handling of floating dialogs

While dialogs should open in floating mode by default [[10]](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_floating), many still open in tiling mode. To change this behaviour, check the dialog's `WM_WINDOW_ROLE` with [xorg-xprop](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xorg-xprop) and add the correct rules to `~/.i3/config` (using [pcre](http://www.pcre.org/) syntax):

```
for_window [window_role="pop-up"] floating enable
for_window [window_role="task_dialog"] floating enable

```

You can also use title rules and regular expressions:

```
for_window [title="Preferences$"] floating enable

```

or `WM_CLASS`:

```
for_window [class="(?i)mplayer"] floating enable

```

### Network Download/Upload speed on statusbar

You might adapt this upstream [script](http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3status/tree/contrib/measure-net-speed.bash). For that,

*   rename both network cards according to your system (use `ip addr`)
*   find them on `/sys/devices` then replace them appropriately:

```
$ find /sys/devices -name *network_interface*

```

**Tip:** Use `/sys/class/net/*interface*/statistics/` to not depend on PCI location.

Now, just save the script in a suitable place (for example `~/.config/i3`) and point your status program to it.

## Patches

*   **i3-smart-border** — Smart borders

	[https://github.com/ashinkarov/i3-extras](https://github.com/ashinkarov/i3-extras) || [i3-smart-border](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3-smart-border/)

*   **i3-wm-iconpatch** — Titlebar icon support

	[https://github.com/ashinkarov/i3-extras](https://github.com/ashinkarov/i3-extras) || [i3-wm-iconpatch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3-wm-iconpatch/)

## Troubleshooting

### General

In many cases, bugs are fixed in the development versions [i3-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3-git/) and [i3status-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/i3status-git/), and upstream will ask to reproduce any errors with this version. [[11]](http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html) See also [Debug - Getting Traces#General](/index.php/Debug_-_Getting_Traces#General "Debug - Getting Traces").

### Buttons in the i3 message bar do not work

Buttons such as "Edit config" in `i3-nagbar` call `i3-sensible-terminal`, so make sure your [Terminal emulator](#Terminal_emulator) is recognized by i3.

### Faulty line wraps in tiled terminals

i3 v4.3 and higher ignore size increment hints for tiled windows [[12]](https://www.mail-archive.com/i3-discuss@i3.zekjur.net/msg00709.html). This may cause terminals to wrap lines prematurely, amongst other issues. As a workaround, make the offending window floating, before tiling it again.

### Mouse cursor remains in waiting mode

When starting a script or application which does not support startup notifications, the mouse cursor will remain in busy/watch/clock mode for 60 seconds.

To solve this for a particlar application, use the `--no-startup-id` parameter, for example:

```
exec --no-startup-id ~/script
bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id dmenu_run

```

To disable this animation globally, see [Cursor themes#Create links to missing cursors](/index.php/Cursor_themes#Create_links_to_missing_cursors "Cursor themes").

### Unresponsive key bindings

Some tools such as [scrot](/index.php/Taking_a_screenshot#scrot "Taking a screenshot") may not work when used with a regular key binding (executed after key press). In those cases, execute commands after key release with the `--release` argument [[13]](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings):

```
bindsym --release Print exec --no-startup-id scrot
bindsym --release Shift+Print exec --no-startup-id scrot -s

```

### Tearing

i3 does [not properly implement double buffering](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/661) hence tearing or flickering may occur. To prevent this, install and configure [compton](/index.php/Compton "Compton"). [[14]](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/3279/do-i-need-a-composite-manager-compton/?answer=3282#post-id-3282)

### Tray icons not visible

The default `tray_output primary` directive may require setting a primary output with *xrandr*, or specifying the output explicitly. [[15]](https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/1144) See [Xrandr](/index.php/Xrandr "Xrandr") for details.
