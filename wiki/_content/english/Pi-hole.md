From the [Pi-hole README.md on GitHub](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole):

	The Pi-Holeâ„¢ is an advertising-aware DNS/Web server. If an ad domain is queried, a small Web page or GIF is delivered in place of the advertisement..

	The gravity.sh does most of the magic. The script pulls in ad domains from many sources and compiles them into a single list of over 1.6 million entries (if you decide to use the mahakala list). This script is controlled by the pihole command. Please run pihole -h to see what commands can be run via pihole.

This wiki page tries to cover the need for configuration and use instructions of this Pi-hole adaptations for Archlinux not officially supported by the main project. For bugs, issues and general reporting, plaese refer to [pi-hole-server AUR page](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-server/) for server package or [pi-hole-standalone AUR page](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-standalone/) for standalone package.

## Pi-hole Server

### Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [pi-hole-server](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-server/) package.

**Note:** You will install another AUR package: [pi-hole-ftl](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-ftl/), instructions are in [#FTL](#FTL) specific section.

### First install configuration

#### Dnsmasq

As a first step, you need to setup dnsmasq. It will resolve DNS queries for your lan filtering ads with pi-hole.

**If you already use dnsmasq**, edit your /etc/dnsmasq.conf to uncomment last line and include new pi-hole config filed located at /etc/dnsmasq.d directory:

```
# sed -i 's|#conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|' /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```

**If you installed dnsmasq with Pi-hole for the first time**, backup original dnsmasq config file and copy pi-hole main one:

```
# cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.orig
# cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.main /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```

If necessary, [enable](/index.php/Enable "Enable") `dnsmasq.service` and re/start it:

**Warning:** Point DNS resolution of your lan clients to Pi-hole machine.

#### Web Server

Now you need to choose a web server for the Pi-hole web interface to work.
Main project provide configurations and support for [lighttpd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=lighttpd) but Archlinux package provide config files also for [nginx](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nginx).

**Note:** The use of [nginx](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nginx) is under construction

Pi-hole need use of default site of your web server to redirect to it all DNS filtered requests. If you already have an active default site you need to reconfigure your server accordingly.

##### Lighttpd

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [lighttpd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=lighttpd). Backup original config file and copy pi-hole one:

```
# cp /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.orig
# cp /etc/pihole/configs/lighttpd.conf /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

```

If necessary, [enable](/index.php/Enable "Enable") `lighttpd.service` and re/start it:

##### Nginx

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [nginx](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nginx) or [nginx-mainline](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nginx-mainline) and [php-fpm](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=php-fpm).

Edit `/etc/php/php-fpm.d/www.conf` and changing the listen directive to the following:

```
listen = 127.0.0.1:9000  

```

Modify `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to contain the following in the **http** section:

```
gzip            on;
gzip_min_length 1000;
gzip_proxied    expired no-cache no-store private auth;
gzip_types      text/plain application/xml application/json application/javascript application/octet-stream text/css;
include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;

```

Copy the package provided default config for pi-hole:

```
# mkdir /etc/nginx/conf.d
# cp /etc/pihole/configs/nginx.pi-hole.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

```

If necessary, [enable](/index.php/Enable "Enable") `nginx.service` `php-fpm.service` `pi-hole-ftl.service`and re/start them.

### Update/Upgrade configuration

**Tip:** If updating you don't see a post install message saying that dnsmasq and/or web server config files are changed, you can skip this section.

If necessary, update dnsmasq config file

```
# [ -f /etc/dnsmasq.orig ] && cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.main /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```

and re/start it.

If necessary, update lighttpd config file

```
# [ -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.orig ] && cp /etc/pihole/configs/lighttpd.conf /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

```

and re/start it.

If necessary, update nginx config file

```
# cp /etc/pihole/configs/nginx.pi-hole.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

```

and re/start it.

### Web interface

Before Pi-hole version 3.0, no further configuration was required to PHP installation. Since ver. 3.0 it is mandatory to enable the sockets extension in php.ini.

 `/etc/php/php.ini` 
```
[...]
extension=sockets.so
[...]
```

Currently, Pi-hole web interface is very complete and well done. You can configure nearly every aspect of [dnsmasq](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dnsmasq), execute lots of Pi-hole available commands and monitor ads filtering. You can connect to web interface at

```
http://<IP/Hostname of Pi-hole machine>/admin/

```

or

```
[http://pi.hole/admin](http://pi.hole/admin)

```

### FTL

FTL is part of Pi-hole project. It is a Database Like, Wrapper, API provider frontend to Pi-hole DNS query log. It is used by web interface since version 3.0.

The FTL service is statically enabled. You only need to [start](/index.php/Start "Start") it.

You can configure FTL in `/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf`. [Read](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL#ftls-config-file) project documentation for details.

## Pi-hole Standalone

The Archlinux Pi-hole Standalone variant is born from the need to use pi-hole services in a mobile context. [Sky-hole article](http://dlaa.me/blog/post/skyhole) was inspirational.

### Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [pi-hole-standalone](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pi-hole-standalone/) package.

### First install configuration

#### Dnsmasq

As a first step, you need to setup dnsmasq. It will resolve DNS queries for your machine filtering ads with pi-hole.

**If you already use dnsmasq**, edit your /etc/dnsmasq.conf to uncomment last line and include new pi-hole config filed located at /etc/dnsmasq.d directory:

```
# sed -i 's|#conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|' /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```

**If you installed dnsmasq with Pi-hole for the first time**, backup original dnsmasq config file and copy pi-hole main one:

```
# cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.orig
# cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.main /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```

If necessary, [enable](/index.php/Enable "Enable") `dnsmasq.service` and re/start it:

#### Openresolve

Edit your /etc/resolvconf.conf and uncomment name_servers line (last line) and update resolvconf:

```
# sed -i 's|#name_servers=127.0.0.1|name_servers=127.0.0.1|' /etc/resolvconf.conf
# resolvconf -u

```

you will now always resolve hostnames querying localhost, and [dnsmasq](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dnsmasq) will listen.

### Update/Upgrade configuration

**Tip:** If updating you don't see a post install message saying that dnsmasq config file is changed, you can skip this section.

If necessary, update dnsmasq config file

```
# [ -f /etc/dnsmasq.orig ] && cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.main /etc/dnsmasq.conf

```

and re/start it.

## Troubleshooting

There seems to be a [problem](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/issues/1434) with chrome and the web interface graphs rendering. Right now, upstream issue is closed.
