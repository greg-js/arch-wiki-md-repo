## Packages that can be converted to arch=any

List thanks to Gerardo ([http://archlinux.djgera.com.ar/misc/any-20091019.txt](http://archlinux.djgera.com.ar/misc/any-20091019.txt)). Care needs to be taken as some packages in the original list contained references to the arch in their scripts (e.g. pacman-mirrorlist, abs)
