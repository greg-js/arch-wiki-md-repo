Arch Linux is currently running successfully on this laptop. As of February 2007, it is the only linux distribution I have tried which correctly reports the battery/power status. This is the version with a Celeron M processor, and originally with 256MB RAM and no wireless. I've since upgraded to 1GB RAM and the Intel 3945 Wireless which is the standard card for other nx6310s which come with it.

#### wireless

To enable the Intel 3945 Wireless card I had to install the ipw3945 package. I then added ipw3945 to the MODULES section of rc.conf and ipw3945d to the DAEMONS section **before** network. I use NetworkManager to handle the mutiple wireless networks I need to connect to and there were issues with no wireless devices showing up in KNetworkManager. There were two different causes of this:

*   My user wasn't part of the users group
*   You need to turn the wireless card on by pressing the button next to the power button - this isn't needed everytime I boot up so I'm not sure what the pattern is

#### sound

Worked out of the box
