## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [kitty](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=kitty) package.

## Usage

New tabs and windows can be created and resized through various `ctrl+shift` shortcuts. Layouts are switchable through `ctrl+shift+l` and can be saved/restored. A *full keyboard mode* provides distinction between ambiguous keys like `ctrl+i` vs `tab`. Moreover, new text effects like curly-underline are also available for applications that support it.

## Configuration

Kitty is configurable in `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`. Fonts, colors, cursors and scrollback behaviors can be adjusted.
