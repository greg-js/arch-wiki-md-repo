**Note:** Because of my bluetooth not working, I'am still stuck to the uncomfortable option to master the ugly touthpad here. As of FEB/2012 this is still true, except that bluetooth can be enabled with a special procedure involving Windows

# Device Information

There are many configurations for these models of HP Probooks. Mine is like the following "lspci". Mostly, the stuff in lspci is pretty meaningless, because your OS (most likely Arch) will pick up all the device modules automatically, so you should't worry or pay too close attention to them. The most and only items in the lspci are your **graphics card** and your **wireless networking card**.

## other devices needing an attention

**Note:** some updated information- read below.

*   **Synaptics Clikpad** (looks like a touchpad, but it has both of the buttons integrated in the overall touching zone of the touchpad).
*   **Battery life!!!** Huuuuge difference of battery life when win7 and Arch compared. I suspect it to be tricky configuration of **lm-sensors**, **cpufreq**, and **acpi** alltogether.

Updated information:

*   **Clickpad** It works pretty good, if package from AUR is isnstalled. This package removes the original xf86-input-synaptics package. With this AUR package, no /etc/X11/xorg.d/[files] are needed anymore, specially if you use gnome/kde of other environment settings. Both buttons work well, and both scrolling hor/vert are working too. If you want also the LED tapp to work, you must install another package form AUR.
*   **Battery** Well, it is still true for the most part, although utilising pm-utils configuration takes care of that quite well. One thing I cannot seem to figure out still is the cooling fans.

# Configuration

## Networking

### WLAN

**Note:** some updated information- read below.

This notebook comes, in my opinion, equiped the worst choice of wireless hardware. Definetely, for linux users. The Ralink **combo card RT3090** is quite new, and Ralink promises extremely welcome support for the Linux community. However, the drivers supplied by them are nothing more but a pain and bunch of unstable, unusable lines of coding. So for now, let's try using what's already there for us within the linux kernel.

There generally are two drivers. One of with is old and staging, and another much newer, but probably not quite ready. The best choice is to load the older **rt2860sta driver** and blacklist the rest.

*   add "rt2860sta" to the modules array in /etc/rc.conf
*   black list the rest. My /etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf looks like this

```
blacklist rt2800pci
blacklist rt61pci                                              
blacklist rt2800usb
blacklist rt2800lib
blacklist rt2x00usb
blacklist rt2x00lib
blacklist rt2x00pci

```

*   if especially the rt2800pci is not blacklisted, it messes up your wireless stability.

*   Note, as of kernel version 3.0 this section's guide is deprecated. rt2800pci is currently the only working wifi method for this device. As noted above, connection stability is poor.

**Updated information** Untill the latest kernel rt2800pci module worked good. This module is also the default one that get loaded automatically. For me it was hugely unstable, so I started to dig into Ralink original driver, and as of now I can declare some significant SUCCESSS. I have been able to compile the Ralink driver (with many trials+errors) and it seems to work alright. I seem to experience the speed overload issue [[1]](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1600498) however, but I am not sure whe the problem comes form just yet. Of course, I can blame Rlinks alrgight, but just before I do that, I will tinker with the driver settings prior-compiling. So far it helped. What I did berofe compiling is his: In the original Ralink driver find , open it with edit and edit lines: -

```
file config.mk in os/linux folder:
HAS_ATE=y (originally was n) - 
HAS_WPA_SUPPLICANT=y (originally was n) - 
HAS_NATIVE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_SUPPORT=y (originally was n) and - 
HAS_ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SUPPORT=y originally was n) 

```

Then compile as normal, install, and load the driver. I also did iwpriv command to supress the uneeded log spit.

### Bluetooth [Working!!]

**Note:** As of 2013.11.13 Bluetooth is working for RT3090\. After installing bluez, bluez-utils and any other bluetooth related packages you may need, run "bccmd enabletx" as root. No need to dual boot with Windows, only running the command.

As the half-mini **wireless card RT3090** is a combo one, the bluetooth radio is embeded together with wifi. The bluetooth device isn't listed in lspci. However, is is visible with hciconfig -a command. /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d # hciconfig -a

```

```

Looks good as it should, but **there is no radio activity!** Nothing shows up on scannig neither direction. I assume, the driver is either dead, or I am missing something.

**Note:** Please, fill me in if you know how to get the bluetooth working Bluetooth works only if dualbooted with windows, the hard wireless key is disabled before rebooting, and then already in Linux, you press the key again. This enables back the wireless device along with the bluetooth radio as well.

**Note:** *bccmd enabletx* as root (or with sudo) works for me in Ubuntu, might apply here too...

## Graphics

### Video card ATI

Not much to say.. Just install the required package with pacman and you are all set. Your system will pick up the driver at the next lounch of X. The package is **xf86-video-ati**. Works without an issue. FGLRX works normally, that is to say, with poor stability and compatibility, Wine gaming is

## Input Devices

### Clikpad (touchpad)

**Note:** All the configs below are NOT needed if yo use Gnome or other DE settings for your mouse/pad. All taps, buttons, scrolls are WORKING if you install synaptics package from AUR

The touchpad -clickpad is a pain. Unless you are already using the **2.6.38 kernel** (as you shoud) and **xf86-input-synaptics 1.4.0-2** package (wich came out pretty much the same day), your clikpad will be jittering and acting annoyingly with the default settings. I managed to get it working somewhat well by tweaking it with the /etc/X11/xorg.d/10-synaptics.conf file *see below*.

Now - with the synaptics package older than "xf86-input-synaptics 1.4.0-2", there are many things to tweak to get your clikpad working somewhat good. You will still miss the right-clik (the real click) button though, but I worked around this problem by making a soft-clik out of a two-finger touch that emulates the right-button click with inserting "Option "RTCornerButton" "2" in the config file.

Note, that normaly you shoudn't have **any other files** in the ..xorg.d/ directory that state configurations for input devices, unless you need specific configs for other input devices. When I connect external mouse, it works without any specific configuration.

Here is my /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf file.

```

What is achieved with these setings are explained in the comments in the file.

### ClickPad with newest synaptics package

**Note:** Users, please, help updating this information, as it is far from complete

Now, with the newer package form Synaptics (1.4.0-2) I was really expecting much more improvement. However, it comes with some degree of dissapointment. First I tried to roll on without any aditional configuration of the device. I left it with the default settings that came with the new version of synaptics package.

*   First, the clickpad seems to work smoother than before - thank you!
*   However, the right-button is still missing. Vertical-two-finger sroll is working out-of-the-box - thank you!
*   The default sensitivity of the clickpad is set too much - bad!
*   None of the true wonders of clickpad are available (correct me if I am wrong)
    *   wonders like two-finger-zoom (stealed from apple),
    *   two-finger rotation,
    *   finger-movement inertia (really nice option- I very much like it),
    *   scrolling inertia (also very useful),
    *   Clickpad off button in the upper-left corner.
*   I have the opportunity to test all the wonders of the clickpad, because I **double-boot my Probook with Windows7**. Where all the features of the clickpad are available.

### Working w/o aditional settings in ../xorg.d/: with the newer Synaptics package

This is the **default config file**, let's use it and see how it goes.. /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf

```
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "synaptics"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Option "TapButton1" "1"
        Option "TapButton2" "2"
        Option "TapButton3" "3"
EndSection

```

When reverting to using the same (my tweaked file) config file as listed above, everything works pretty much the same as with the newer driver, except that more options come default.

### What's needed is the real buttons work

**Note:** Please, contributors wanted to update this information

## Power related configurations

**Note:** Everything here is related to the notebook running on batteries

So far I seem to have configured the following things to my understanding, but the most annoying thing remains- **battery life is BAD!** I can see outmost 1h50m when unplugged. In Win7 with the HP PowerAssistant common tweaks, I see 3h40m right after unplugging.

*   Cooler fan is running, which makes me think, that the cpu's are overloaded. But they are not.
*   cpufreq-info says my cpu cores all are governed by the "conservative" mode. Later changed it to powersave mode.
*   command "watch grep \"cpu MHz\" /proc/cpuinfo" shows cpu cores at the lowest Mhz,
*   laptop-mode is enabled and configured properly.

### cpufreq

### laptop-mode

*   My settings in /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/cpufreq.conf set the governing of cpu cores accordingly:

```
BATT_CPU_MAXFREQ=fastest
BATT_CPU_MINFREQ=slowest
BATT_CPU_GOVERNOR=powersave
BATT_CPU_IGNORE_NICE_LOAD=1
LM_AC_CPU_MAXFREQ=fastest
LM_AC_CPU_MINFREQ=slowest
LM_AC_CPU_GOVERNOR=performance
LM_AC_CPU_IGNORE_NICE_LOAD=1
NOLM_AC_CPU_MAXFREQ=fastest
NOLM_AC_CPU_MINFREQ=slowest
NOLM_AC_CPU_GOVERNOR=performance
NOLM_AC_CPU_IGNORE_NICE_LOAD=0

```

But actually, my fans run quieter when notebook is charging, and cpu governor is "prformance". Can you beat that? Before I had the "BATT_CPU_GOVERNOR=conservative" which seemed to log a unknown error. Later I changed it to "powersave", and now my log reads:

```
ACPI group/action undefined: processor / CPU0
ACPI group/action undefined: processor / CPU1
ACPI group/action undefined: processor / CPU2
ACPI group/action undefined: processor / CPU3

```

I am not sure what this "action undefined" means. Hope nothing bad.

### lm-ensors

*   After configuring lm-sensors, the command "sensors" are not showing the RPM data of systems fans.

I suspect the problem to be there...
