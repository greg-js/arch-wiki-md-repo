## Preliminaries

1.  Create a recovery device in Windows 10\. It required a USB-only (no SD card, no optical media?) flash drive greater than 8 GB. Formatting FAT32 works.
2.  [Update the BIOS.](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/yast-3jwkjx) At this time of writing, the latest BIOS is 2.15 (2017-05-30). Lenovo provides a bootable, standalone ["BIOS Update CD"](http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds106086) to perform this update outside of Windows.
3.  Getting **into** the BIOS is difficult, so [here are some instructions](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/sf13-t0025) that seemed to work. The easiest way was through Windows 10.
4.  In the BIOS, you will want to disable UEFI Secure Boot, change the boot order to look at USB devices first, allow `F12` to bypass the BIOS, and possibly enable the verbose mode because it is easier to press the appropriate buttons on time.

## Installation

This machine can boot either via EFI or grub.

This section assumes that you've successfully created bootable Arch install media to a USB drive. The label of the USB installer must be correct (ARCH_201604 in this case). Restart the computer boot from the USB drive. You may need to press `F12` at some point to trigger a boot order override.

You need an internet connection; this guide got both ethernet and wifi to work. Find the interfaces with `ip link`.

Ethernet: turn on DHCP with

```
# dhcpcd *<interface>* 

```

Wifi: wifi-menu worked here, the appropriate SSID was selected with the right password.

The font sizes will make you feel very far away. To deal with this, fonts are in `/usr/share/kbd/consolefonts`.

You can see the currently selected font with showconsolefont. The font was changed here to `sun12x22` with: `setfont sun12x22`. It is a little better.

Following the [Beginner's guide](/index.php/Beginner%27s_guide "Beginner's guide") to install Arch.

Shutdown, remove the USB drive, and then boot the computer, and make sure the installed drive is first in the BIOS.

## Configuration

### Keyboard

To control the keyboard backlight, you change the value using:

```
echo 1 | sudo dd of=/sys/class/leds/tpacpi\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness

```

for values 0â€“2.

### Sound

The status of audio output over HDMI, Thunderbolt, and/or Mini Displayport is unknown.

### Integrated Graphics

The integrated Intel GPU should work (mostly) without configuration using the [xf86-video-intel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-intel) package. If you experience crashes or hangs, please see [Intel graphics#Skylake support](/index.php/Intel_graphics#Skylake_support "Intel graphics") for additional configuration.

### Dedicated Graphics

There is a BIOS option for turning off the Intel Integrated Graphics and only running the NVIDIA discrete card. While it is possible to get the console working with this configuration, there are no confirmed reports of X.org working in this setup.

[NVIDIA Optimus#Using nvidia](/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus#Using_nvidia "NVIDIA Optimus") contains instructions on configuring Xorg to use your Nvidia Quadro GPU. Be sure to select the "Hybrid Graphics" in your BIOS. The official [nvidia](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=nvidia) driver package supports hybrid GPU configuration without requiring the use of Noveau/PRIME or Bumblebee. The following example configuration enables the GPU using the proprietary driver. Pay close attention to the ConstrainCursor and AccelMethod directives.

 `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`

EndSection
```

### External Displays

DisplayPort over USB-C, HDMI, and Mini DisplayPort outputs all work using the above configuration with the proprietary Nvidia driver. HDMI has also been confirmed to work using Bumblebee and `intel-virtual-output`.

Limited testing suggests that a maximum of 3 total displays from 2 output types may be used at one time. For example, two external DP/USB-C displays and the one internal display will achieve the maximum of three.

**Warning:** Hot-swapping between different external display types has been known to hardlock the Nvidia driver. Change outputs at your own risk!

### HiDPI
