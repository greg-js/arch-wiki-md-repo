## Backlight

You need to add `acpi_backlight=native` to your [kernel parameters](/index.php/Kernel_parameters "Kernel parameters").

## Power management

### Suspend and resume

Users have reported that the laptop is waking up immediately after entering suspending (see [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/ckkbej/t495_linux_avoid/) and [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/cveeyl/linux_on_t495t495sx395_suspendresume_fix/)). However, this seems to be fixed in the latest kernel. Suspend and resume works fine out-of-the-box.

### TLP

If you have installed [TLP](/index.php/TLP "TLP") to enable advance power management, you might notice that USB ports will not work under battery mode. Disable [Runtime Power Management](https://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html#runtimepm) for USB controllers to fix this. To get PCIe device addresses of USB controllers:

```
$ lspci | grep -i usb

```

The first column of the output is the address:

```
03:00.4 USB controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Device 816d (rev 0e)
07:00.3 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Raven USB 3.1
07:00.4 USB controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Raven USB 3.1

```

To disable runtime power management for these devices, edit `/etc/default/tlp`:

 `/etc/default/tlp`  `RUNTIME_PM_BLACKLIST="03:00.4 07:00.3 07:00.4"`
