From [nxt.org](https://nxt.org/):

	*Nxt is a radically enhanced cryptocurrency built from scratch, delivering a unique and decentralized financial platform. Not only does it open up new possibilities – from digital money to transfer of shares – but it addresses all of the most serious deficiencies in existing cryptocurrencies.*

## Installation

NXT is available with the [nxt-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nxt-git/) package providing compilation from the latest source or the [nxt](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nxt/) package for the compiled version.

## Usage

First, enable and [start](/index.php/Start "Start") the `nxt.service` or `nxt-tor.service`. For the `nxt-tor.service` you will also need to install [tor](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=tor).

Once the NXT service is running, start the client by running `nxt` from the terminal or use the NRS desktop shortcut.

For more information on how to use NRS, see the [NXT wiki](https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/Nxt_client_interface).
