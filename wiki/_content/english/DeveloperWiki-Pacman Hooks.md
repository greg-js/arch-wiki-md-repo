# Hooks!

## systemd-tmpfiles

Used by 52 packages

Proposed hook (systemd)

```
[Trigger]
Type = File
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Target = usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf

[Action]
Description = Creating temporary files...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /bin/sh -c 'while read -r f; do /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles --create "/$f"; done'
NeedsTargets

```

## systemd-sysusers

Used by 29 packages

sysusers also runs at boot via ConditionNeedsUpdate, see below, so depending on whether that works and when we need the users to exist this hook might not be needed.

Proposed hook (systemd)

```
[Trigger]
Type = File
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Target = usr/lib/sysusers.d/*.conf

[Action]
Description = Updating system user accounts...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /bin/sh -c 'while read -r f; do /usr/bin/systemd-sysusers "/$f"Â ; done'
NeedsTargets

```

## udevadm hwdb, systemd-hwdb

Used by 5 packages

This SHOULD be run with --usr, resulting in /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin instead of /etc/udev/hwdb.bin.

Although the latter database overrides the former, this would not be a problem since systemd-hwdb-update.service will update /etc/udev/hwdb.bin at boot if /etc/udev/hwdb.bin exists OR /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin does not exist OR /etc/udev/hwdb.d is not empty.

However, this service is also gated on ConditionNeedsUpdate=/etc, which passes if /usr has a newer mtime than /etc/.updated. Unfortunately, ConditionNeedsUpdate (used in quite a few services!) is broken for us since pacman will not update the mtime of directories that already exist, such as /usr. This can be worked around with another hook.

If this workaround hook is unacceptable, it and the --usr argument can be dropped.

Proposed hook (systemd)

```
[Trigger]
Type = File
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Remove
Target = usr

[Action]
Description = Updating /usr...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/touch -c /usr

```

Proposed hook (systemd)

```
[Trigger]
Type = File
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Remove
Target = usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d/*.hwdb

[Action]
Description = Updating udev hardware database...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/systemd-hwdb --usr update

```

## fc-cache

Used by 53 packages

Proposed hook (fontconfig)

```
[Trigger]
Type = File
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Remove
Target = usr/share/fonts/*

[Action]
Description = Updating fontconfig cache...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/fc-cache -s

```

## mkfontscale/mkfontdir

Used by 39 packages

Proposed hook (xorg-mkfontdir)

```
[Trigger]

Target = usr/share/fonts/*/*.otf
Target = usr/share/fonts/*/*.pcf.gz
Target = usr/share/fonts/*/*.pfa
Target = usr/share/fonts/*/*.pfb
Target = usr/share/fonts/*/*.ttf

[Action]
Description = Creating index of X font files...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /bin/sh -c 'while read -r f; do dirname $f; done | uniq | while read -r d; do mkfontscale /$d && mkfontdir /$d; done'
NeedsTargets
