## udevadm hwdb, systemd-hwdb

Used by 5 packages

This SHOULD be run with --usr, resulting in /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin instead of /etc/udev/hwdb.bin.

Although the latter database overrides the former, this would not be a problem since systemd-hwdb-update.service will update /etc/udev/hwdb.bin at boot if /etc/udev/hwdb.bin exists OR /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin does not exist OR /etc/udev/hwdb.d is not empty.

However, this service is also gated on ConditionNeedsUpdate=/etc, which passes if /usr has a newer mtime than /etc/.updated. Unfortunately, ConditionNeedsUpdate (used in quite a few services!) is broken for us since pacman will not update the mtime of directories that already exist, such as /usr.

Proposed hook (systemd)

```
