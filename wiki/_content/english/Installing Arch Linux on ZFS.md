## Installation

See [ZFS#Installation](/index.php/ZFS#Installation "ZFS") for installing the ZFS packages. If installing Arch Linux onto ZFS from the archiso, it would be easier to use the [demz-repo-archiso](/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#demz-repo-archiso "Unofficial user repositories") repository.

### Embedding archzfs into archiso

See [ZFS](/index.php/ZFS#Embed_the_archzfs_packages_into_an_archiso "ZFS") article.

## Partition the destination drive

Review [Beginners' guide#Prepare the storage devices](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide#Prepare_the_storage_devices "Beginners' guide") for information on determining the partition table type to use for ZFS. ZFS supports GPT and MBR partition tables.

ZFS manages its own partitions, so only a basic partition table scheme is required. The partition that will contain the ZFS filesystem should be of the type `bf00`, or "Solaris Root".

When using GRUB on a BIOS machine there is no need for a boot partition.

### Partition scheme

Here is an example, using MBR, of a basic partition scheme that could be employed for your ZFS root setup:

```
Part     Size   Type
----     ----   -------------------------
   1     XXXG   Solaris Root (bf00)

```

Here is an example using GPT. The BIOS boot partition contains the bootloader.

```
Part     Size   Type
----     ----   -------------------------
   1       2M   BIOS boot partition (ef02)
   1     512M   Ext boot partition (8300)
   2     XXXG   Solaris Root (bf00)

```

An additional partition may be required depending on your hardware and chosen bootloader. Consult [Beginners' guide#Install and configure a bootloader](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide#Install_and_configure_a_bootloader "Beginners' guide") for more info.

**Tip:** Bootloaders with support for ZFS are described in [#Install and configure the bootloader](#Install_and_configure_the_bootloader).

**Warning:** Several GRUB bugs ([bug #42861](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?42861), [zfsonlinux/grub/issues/5](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/grub/issues/5)) complicate installing it on ZFS partitions, see [Installing_Arch_Linux_on_ZFS#Install_and_configure_the_bootloader](/index.php/Installing_Arch_Linux_on_ZFS#Install_and_configure_the_bootloader "Installing Arch Linux on ZFS") for a workaround

## Format the destination disk

If you have opted for a boot partition as well as any other non-ZFS system partitions then format them. Do not do anything to the Solaris partition nor to the BIOS boot partition. ZFS will manage the first, and your bootloader the second.

## Setup the ZFS filesystem

First, make sure the ZFS modules are loaded,

```
# modprobe zfs

```

### Create the root zpool

```
# zpool create -f zroot /dev/disk/by-id/*id-to-partition-partx*

```

**Warning:**

*   Always use id names when working with ZFS, otherwise import errors will occur.
*   The zpool command will normally activate all features. See [ZFS#GRUB-compatible pool creation](/index.php/ZFS#GRUB-compatible_pool_creation "ZFS") when using [GRUB](/index.php/GRUB "GRUB").

### Create necessary filesystems

If so desired, sub-filesystem mount points such as `/home` and `/root` can be created with the following commands:

```
# zfs create zroot/home -o mountpoint=/home
# zfs create zroot/root -o mountpoint=/root

```

Note that if you want to use other datasets for system directories (`/var` or `/etc` included) your system will not boot unless they are listed in `/etc/fstab`! We will address that at the appropriate time in this tutorial.

### Swap partition

See [ZFS#Swap volume](/index.php/ZFS#Swap_volume "ZFS").

### Configure the root filesystem

If you have just created your zpool, it will be mounted in a dir at the root of your tree named after the pool (ie /zroot) so first we need to unmount it:

```
# zfs umount -a

```

Now set the mount point of the root filesystem:

```
# zfs set mountpoint=/ zroot

```

and optionally, any sub-filesystems:

```
# zfs set mountpoint=/home zroot/home
# zfs set mountpoint=/root zroot/root

```

and if you have separate datasets for system directories (ie `/var` or `/usr`)

```
# zfs set mountpoint=legacy zroot/usr
# zfs set mountpoint=legacy zroot/var

```

and put them in `/etc/fstab`

 `/etc/fstab` 
```
# <file system>        <dir>         <type>    <options>              <dump> <pass>
zroot/usr              /usr          zfs       defaults,noatime       0      0
zroot/var              /var          zfs       defaults,noatime,acl   0      0
```

Note that the `/var` filesystem requires the [Access Control List enabled (acl)](/index.php/Systemd#systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service_fails_to_start_at_boot "Systemd") that in zfs it is disabled by default. To enable it use `zfs set`:

```
# zfs set xattr=sa zroot/var
# zfs set acltype=posixacl zroot/var

```

The property `xattr=sa` is not mandatory, but suggested. Check `man zfs` for all details.

Set the bootfs property on the descendant root filesystem so the boot loader knows where to find the operating system.

```
# zpool set bootfs=zroot zroot

```

Export the pool,

```
# zpool export zroot

```

**Warning:** Do not skip this, otherwise you will be required to use `-f` when importing your pools. This unloads the imported pool.

**Note:** This might fail if you added a swap partition above. Need to turn it off with the *swapoff* command.

Finally, re-import the pool,

```
# zpool import -d /dev/disk/by-id -R /mnt zroot

```

**Note:** `-d` is not the actual device id, but the `/dev/by-id` directory containing the symbolic links.

If there is an error in this step, you can export the pool to redo the command. The ZFS filesystem is now ready to use.

Be sure to bring the zpool.cache file into your new system. This is required later for the ZFS daemon to start.

```
# cp /etc/zfs/zpool.cache /mnt/etc/zfs/zpool.cache

```

if you do not have /etc/zfs/zpool.cache, create it:

```
# zpool set cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache zroot

```

## Install and configure Arch Linux

Follow the following steps using the [Beginners' guide](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide "Beginners' guide"). It will be noted where special consideration must be taken for ZFSonLinux.

*   First mount any boot or system partitions using the mount command.

*   Install the base system.

*   The procedure described in [Beginners' guide#Generate an fstab](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide#Generate_an_fstab "Beginners' guide") is usually overkill for ZFS. ZFS usually auto mounts its own partitions, so we do not need ZFS partitions in `fstab` file, unless the user made datasets of system directories. To generate the `fstab` for filesystems, use:

```
# genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

```

*   Edit the `/etc/fstab`:

**Note:**

*   If you chose to create datasets for system directories, keep them in this `fstab`! Comment out the lines for the '`/`, `/root`, and `/home` mountpoints, rather than deleting them. You may need those UUIDs later if something goes wrong.
*   Anyone who just stuck with the guide's directions can delete everything except for the swap file and the boot/EFI partition. It seems convention to replace the swap's uuid with `/dev/zvol/zroot/swap`.

*   You need to add the Arch ZFS repo, sign its key and install zfs-git within the arch-chroot before you can update the ramdisk with ZFS support

*   When creating the initial ramdisk, first edit `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and add `zfs` before filesystems. Also, move `keyboard` hook before `zfs` so you can type in console if something goes wrong. You may also remove fsck (if you are not using Ext3 or Ext4). Your `HOOKS` line should look something like this:

```
HOOKS="base udev autodetect modconf block keyboard zfs filesystems"

```

**Note:**

*   If you are using a separate dataset for `/usr` and have followed the instructions below, you must make sure you have the `usr` hook enabled after `zfs`, or your system will not boot.

*   Regenerate the initramfs with the command:

```
# mkinitcpio -p linux

```

## Install and configure the bootloader

### For BIOS motherboards

Follow [GRUB#BIOS systems](/index.php/GRUB#BIOS_systems "GRUB") to install GRUB onto your disk. `grub-mkconfig` does not properly detect the ZFS filesystem, so it is necessary to edit `grub.cfg` manually:

 `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` 
```
set timeout=2
set default=0

# (0) Arch Linux
menuentry "Arch Linux" {
    linux /vmlinuz-linux zfs=zroot rw
    initrd /initramfs-linux.img
}

```

if you did not create a separate /boot partition, kernel and initrd paths have to be in the following format:

```
 /dataset/@/actual/path  

```

Example with Arch installed on the main datasetÂ :

```
   linux /@/boot/vmlinuz-linux zfs=zroot rw
   initrd /@/boot/initramfs-linux.img

```

Example with Arch installed on separator dataset zroot/OS/root

```
   linux /OS/root/@/boot/vmlinuz-linux zfs=zroot/OS/root rw 
   initrd /OS/root/@/boot/initramfs-linux.img

```

When you come to installing GRUB, you are likely to get an error like:

```
Failed to get canonical path of /dev/ata-yourdriveid-partx

```

Until this gets fixed, the easiest workaround is to create a symbolic link from the regular Linux device name of the partition to the device name GRUB is looking for:

```
# ln -s /dev/sdax /dev/ata-yourdriveid-partx

```

### For UEFI motherboards

Use `EFISTUB` and `rEFInd` for the UEFI boot loader. See [Beginners' guide#For UEFI motherboards](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide#For_UEFI_motherboards "Beginners' guide"). The kernel parameters in `refind_linux.conf` for ZFS should include `zfs=bootfs` or `zfs=zroot` so the system can boot from ZFS. The `root` and `rootfstype` parameters are not needed.

## Unmount and restart

We are almost done!

```
# exit
# umount /mnt/boot
# zfs umount -a
# zpool export zroot

```

Now reboot.

**Warning:** If you do not properly export the zpool, the pool will refuse to import in the ramdisk environment and you will be stuck at the busybox terminal.

## After the first boot

If everything went fine up to this point, your system will boot. Once. For your system to be able to reboot without issues, you need to enable the `zfs.target` to auto mount the pools and set the hostid.

For each pool you want automatically mounted execute:

```
# zpool set cachefile=/etc/zfs/zpool.cache <pool>

```

Enable the target with [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd"):

```
# systemctl enable zfs.target

```

When running ZFS on root, the machine's hostid will not be available at the time of mounting the root filesystem. There are two solutions to this. You can either place your spl hostid in the [kernel parameters](/index.php/Kernel_parameters "Kernel parameters") in your boot loader. For example, adding `spl.spl_hostid=0x00bab10c`, to get your number use the `hostid` command.

The other, and suggested, solution is to make sure that there is a hostid in `/etc/hostid`, and then regenerate the initramfs image. Which will copy the hostid into the initramfs image. To do write the hostid file safely you need to use a small C program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int res;
    res = sethostid(gethostid());
    if (resÂ != 0) {
        switch (errno) {
            case EACCES:
            fprintf(stderr, "Error! No permission to write the"
                         " file used to store the host ID.
"
                         "Are you root?
");
            break;
            case EPERM:
            fprintf(stderr, "Error! The calling process's effective"
                            " user or group ID is not the same as"
                            " its corresponding real ID.
");
            break;
            default:
            fprintf(stderr, "Unknown error.
");
        }
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

```

Copy it, save it as `writehostid.c` and compile it with `gcc -o writehostid writehostid.c`, finally execute it and regenerate the initramfs image:

```
# ./writehostid
# mkinitcpio -p linux

```

You can now delete the two files `writehostid.c` and `writehostid`. Your system should work and reboot properly now.
