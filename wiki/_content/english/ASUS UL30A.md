## About the laptop

*   13.3" LED Screen 1366 x 768\.
*   4GB DDR3
*   1.3Ghz Dual core.
*   320GB HDD.
*   8-cell battery 84wh.
*   HDMI

## Compatibility

Everything in this laptop is Linux compatible, therefore you will not have any issues installing Linux. I recommend [Xbindkeys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys) for sound buttons. Every other fn-X button works. Suspend, wifi, brightness works. The video out button does not work, use xrandr instead. HDMI works as well. The battery is properly read. Use [laptop-mode-tools](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Laptop#Laptop_mode_tools) for power saving. You can run xorg without config file. xf86-video-intel is the package you need. I could not run x with vesa on this chipset, it just froze completely. HDMI and VGA out works, but not via fn-F8\. You can use lxrandr, GUI for xrandr for setting up video out. You can make fn-f8 work by configuring [Acpid](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Acpid).

### Webcam Flipping

Written by [MessedUpHare](https://bbs.archlinux.org/profile.php?id=49720)

Some models supposedly have their webcams mounted upside down (not confirmed) causing the image to display upside down, this at least affects Skype and Google Hangout.

**Google Hangout in Chromium on x86_64**

```
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /opt/google/talkplugin/GoogleTalkPlugin & chromium

```

the above solution requires lib32-v4l-utils from multilib, I have also installed google-talkplugin from AUR

## Powersaving

See [power saving](/index.php/Power_saving "Power saving").

Written by [lswest](https://bbs.archlinux.org/profile.php?id=17059) (please contact me via my forum profile if you have any questions or problems with this description).

If you can't get laptop-mode-tools adjusting power the way you'd like (I've had many problems with it), you can get the same functionality using pm-powersave, acpi, and acpi-support. Install these packages (acpi-support can be found in the AUR), and rename the file /etc/acpi/sleep.sh to sleep.sh.bak, or move it do a different directory. If you leave it, I've found that my laptop tends to suspend, resume, and suspend, then get stuck. If you find suspend doesn't work without it, feel free to add that information to this section. Also, add acpi and acpi-support to the DAEMONS array, and asus-laptop to your MODULES array of your rc.conf.

As for custom powersaving scripts, you just need to create a bash script within the /etc/pm/power.d/ directory, using a bash case statement with true for on battery, and false for on AC, and then your settings. Make sure they're executable. Below I have a list of files (and their contents) located in my /etc/pm/power.d/ directory, which should cover all basic functionality of laptop-mode-tools (I get between 10 and 12 hours using these scripts depending on my usage).

**Note**: You will need to double-check any file paths to ensure they're correct for your system before using these scripts. They were written for a German Asus UL30A, with a slightly different set of hardware from a UL30Vt.

**Bluetooth**

```
#!/bin/sh
case "$1" in
     true)
         hciconfig hci0 down;
         /etc/rc.d/bluetooth stop;
         rmmod hci_usb;
     ;;
     false)
           modprobe hci_usb;
           hciconfig hci0 up;
           /etc/rc.d/bluetooth start;
     ;;
esac
exit 0

```

**Brightness**

```
#!/bin/sh
case "$1" in
    true)
        echo 2 >> /sys/devices/platform/asus_laptop/backlight/asus_laptop/brightness
    ;;
    false)
        echo 15 >> /sys/devices/platform/asus_laptop/backlight/asus_laptop/brightness
    ;;
esac
exit 0

```

Add `acpi_backlight=vendor` into your bootloader in [kernel parameters](/index.php/Kernel_parameters "Kernel parameters").

**Ethernet**

```
#!/bin/bash
case "$1" in
      true)
           ip link set dev eth0 down
      ;;
      false)
           ip link set dev eth0 up
      ;;
esac
exit 0

```

You can find out a bit more about pm-powersave in the [Pm-utils](/index.php/Pm-utils "Pm-utils") section.

## Fun

This computer has an extra power button on the left, you can configure this with [Xbindkeys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys) and run something useful. Like I use it for switching songs. The extra button is originally for powering up with Asus Express gate.

## Freezes while/after booting

On my UL30A current Arch or Manjaro install won't boot (freeze somewhere along the process) unless I pass `processor.nocst` as kernel parameter. This deactivates a certain APIC feature to determine the C-state but shouldn't affect performance or stability since a legacy one is used instead. Don't forget to add that to your GRUB config afterwards as well.

Other things I pass to the kernel to improve battery life are `nmi_watchdog=0` and `pcie_aspm=force`. You have to see how well those work for you.

In general if you encounter freezes during boot APIC and ACPI should be looked into and deactivated if a solution can't be found.
