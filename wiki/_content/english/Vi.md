According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi "wikipedia:Vi"):

	vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system. The portable subset of the behavior of vi and programs based on it, and the ex editor language supported within these programs, is described by (and thus standardized by) the Single Unix Specification and POSIX.

[vi](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=vi) is part of the [base group](/index.php/Base_group "Base group"). See [vi(1)](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/vi.1) for the manual.
