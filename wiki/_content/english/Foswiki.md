## Installation

**Note:** I abandoned the idea of adopting and maintaining the `foswiki` package on the AUR for the following reasons:

*   Foswiki currently requires some user intervention on every upgrade.
*   Foswiki has a convenient mechanism for installing, updating, and removing plugins that does not function unless the installation directory is writeable.

These instructions assume you will be using the directory `/srv/http/foswiki` to store your Foswiki installation.

The [Foswiki Installation Guide](http://foswiki.org/System/InstallationGuide) is very thorough (although maybe a bit overwhelming), and makes an excellent reference. Follow along using the official guide, but you will find these notes to be more concise, and more specific to ArchLinux.

*   You will need to install the following packages in order for Foswiki to work:
    *   **rcs**
    *   **perl-crypt-passwdmd5**
    *   **perl-cgi-session**
    *   **perl-html-tree**
    *   **perl-json**
    *   **perl-libwww**

*   From the [Foswiki website](http://foswiki.org), determine the URL of the latest Foswiki release.
*   Download and unpack the archive as the `http` user at `/srv/http/foswiki`. For instance (as `root`):

```
# su -s /bin/bash - http
$ mkdir /tmp/foswiki
$ cd /tmp/foswiki
$ wget <archive-url>
$ tar xzf Fos*
$ rm *.tgz
$ exit
# mv /tmp/foswiki/* /srv/http/foswiki
# rmdir /tmp/foswiki
# cd /srv/http/foswiki

```

*   Depending on how keen you are on locking down access to the Foswiki installation, you could restrict access to the installation directory:

```
# chmod o-rx .

```

*   At this point, you want to ensure that all the files have the correct permissions. (See the Foswiki guide on [Setting File Access Permissions](http://foswiki.org/Support.SettingFileAccessRightsLinuxUnix) for details.)

	If you would like to determine whether the files already have the correct permissions, you can make use of `find` to test permissions against the example commands listed in the above Foswiki guide. For instance, this will find any directories that do *not* have their access mode set to 755:

```
# find . -type d \! -perm 755

```

	As of version **1.1.5**, I found that only one file was incorrectly set to be owner-writable; all other files appeared to have the correct permissions fresh out of the archive. The following command can be used to set the correct permissions (either as `root` or `http`), and will also catch any similar files that may display the same issue in future:

```
$ find pub data -name '*,v' -type f -exec chmod 444 \{\} \;

```

*   Copy `bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt` to `bin/LocalLib.cfg`, ensuring that ownership and access rights are identical to the original file.
*   Edit your newly copied file so that the `$foswikiLibPath` line reads as follows:

 `$foswikiLibPath = '/srv/http/foswiki/lib';` 

## Apache

See the [Configure the Webserver](http://foswiki.org/System/InstallationGuide#Configure_the_web_server) section of the Foswiki Installation Guide for guidance on getting set up with Apache.

## Nginx

Setting up Nginx to work correctly with Foswiki is tricky, but almost everything you need is provided here. The configuration is heavily commented, to make it as easy as possible to modify it to suit your needs.

Foswiki is written in Perl and is generally intended to be run as a series of CGI scripts. Check out the [FastCGIEngineContrib](http://foswiki.org/System/FastCGIEngineContrib) if you are interested in running Foswiki as a FastCGI application, but be aware that some plugins do not work well with this setup.

*   Install `fcgiwrap` (See the [Nginx#fcgiwrap](/index.php/Nginx#fcgiwrap "Nginx") page). The rest of this configuration assumes you have set up `fcgiwrap` using a socket.

*   Create a file with the following contents at **/etc/nginx/foswiki.conf**:

```
location /bin/configure {
  # It is important to protect this location with a password.
  auth_basic "Restricted";
  auth_basic_user_file htpasswd/foswiki-configure;
  # (Temporarily?) allow an IP address below for configuration access
  #allow 127.0.0.1;
  deny all;
  fastcgi_pass fcgiwrap;
  include      fastcgi.conf;
  fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/bin/configure)(.*);
  fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
}
location /bin/ {
  fastcgi_pass fcgiwrap;
  include      fastcgi.conf;
  fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/bin/\w+)(.*);
  fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
  # Setting the NO_FOSWIKI_SESSION environment variable prevents a
  # session being created. If a bot is spawning too many sessions, add its
  # user agent string to this regexp.
  set $no_foswiki_session "";
  if ($http_user_agent ~* "^gsa-crawler") {
    set $no_foswiki_session true;
  }
  fastcgi_param NO_FOSWIKI_SESSION $no_foswiki_session;
  # This prevents theÂ %INCLUDE% macro from including our own topics as URLs
  # and also prevents other Foswikis from doing the same. This is important to
  # prevent the most obvious Denial of Service attacks.
  if ($http_user_agent = "") { return 403; }
}
# Contains public-facing files.
# The rewrite rule is necessary for enforcing access policies. Otherwise,
# access would be free to this directory. Comment it out if you do not like
# the performance hit (but see /pub/... locations below).
location /pub/ {
  rewrite ^/pub/(.*)$ /bin/viewfile/$1 last;
}
# Prevent HTML attachments from rendering directly in the browser; it could
# potentially be a security risk.
location ~* /pub/.*\.html?$ {
  types {}
  default_type application/octet-stream;
}
# These locations contain CSS, JS, and other assets that are trusted and really
# need to be cached, and that we do not want going through CGI for reasons of
# performance. The ^~ prefix prevents the above HTML security fix from applying
# to these locations (e.g. WYSIWYG uses some HTML from /pub/System).
location ^~ /pub/System/ {  # General system support files
}
location ^~ /pub/Main/SitePreferences/ {  # Attachments for site logos etc...
}
# Anything in the Trash should not be visible.
# This is not necessary if access policies are being enforced for the /pub
# directory through the rewrite rule above.
#location /pub/Trash {
#  deny all;
#}
location /robots.txt {
}
# Pretty URLs: /Main/Foo, /edit/Main/Foo, etc...
location / {
  rewrite ^/(?:[A-Z].*)?$ /bin/view$uri last;
  rewrite ^/([a-z]+/[A-Z].*) /bin/$1 last;
  # The above should catch most day-to-day things. This is for some more unusual
  # situations (e.g. when Main requires authentication, when resubmitting a
  # form, maybe some other situations):
  rewrite ^ /bin$uri last;
}
```

**Warning:** When working on a production installation, take care of the `allow` directive near the top of the file. Keep it commented out when you do not need access to the `configure` script. This script is a potential security weak point for Foswiki, and is best kept locked down when it is not needed.

*   Uncomment the `allow` directive near the top of the file, and replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of your local machine.
*   Now, add a new server section to your main **nginx** configuration file at **/etc/nginx/nginx.conf**; for instance:

```
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name foswiki;
  root /srv/http/foswiki;

  include foswiki.conf;
}

```

*   If you have not done so already, add an `upstream` block before the `server` blocks in **nginx.conf**, as the **foswiki.conf** file references this:

```
upstream fcgiwrap {
  server unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.sock;
}

```

*   Follow the [instructions from the Nginx Wiki](http://wiki.nginx.org/Faq#How_do_I_generate_an_.htpasswd_file_without_having_Apache_tools_installed.3F) to create an `htpasswd` file at the required location. The above configuration expects such a file at **/etc/nginx/htpasswd/foswiki-configure**. Do not forget to set sensible file permissions for this file. For instance, as `root`:

```
# mkdir -p /etc/nginx/htpasswd
# cd /etc/nginx/htpasswd
# printf "admin:$(openssl passwd -crypt <YOURPASSWORD>)
" >> foswiki-configure
# chgrp http foswiki-configure
# chmod 640 foswiki-configure

```

*   Navigate your browser to the **/configure** URL, e.g.: [http://foswiki/configure](http://foswiki/configure).
*   In the **General Path Settings** section, remove the contents of the `{ScriptUrlPaths}{view`} setting. It should be completely blank. (This will make Foswiki use the pretty URLs we have set up in the Nginx configuration.)
*   All other settings should be fine, so press "Save Changes", and choose a password to protect your configuration. (You may as well use the same password you set for your HTTP Basic Authentication.)
*   Review the Foswiki configuration as desired, and save once more.
*   Comment out the `allow` directive near the top of **/etc/nginx/foswiki.conf** to protect the `configure` script.
*   Your Foswiki installation should now be complete.

## After Installation

Once your wiki is set up, you way also want to set up **cron** rules for:

*   [E-mail notifications](http://foswiki.org/System/MailerContrib)
*   [Web statistics](http://foswiki.org/System/SiteToolStatistics)

## Upgrade

The [Foswiki Upgrade Guide](http://foswiki.org/System.UpgradeGuide) is the official reference for the upgrade process, and is generally sufficient to help you with the upgrade. Remember to install any plugins that were used in the old installation. The easiest way to do this is to compare the `lib/Foswiki/Plugins` directories. The most painful part of the upgrade process is the copying of topics from the old installation to the new. A script is available that almost completely automates this process, leaving you only with the task of merging a few core topics that were modified in the old installation.

You can find the script here: [https://github.com/giddie/bits-n-pieces/blob/master/Foswiki/foswiki-copy](https://github.com/giddie/bits-n-pieces/blob/master/Foswiki/foswiki-copy).

*   Use `diff` (or your favourite derivative) to compare **lib/LocalSite.cfg** and any topics that need merging manually.
*   It may be best to edit certain topics via the Web interface if you want Foswiki to save a revision with the original contents.
*   Do not forget to copy:
    *   The **<topic>.txt,v** file containing the revision data if you are simply clobbering the new topic with the old one.
    *   The **pub** folder of any topic you are merging manually, if it exists.
    *   The **data/.htpasswd** file, which contains the users' password hashes.
