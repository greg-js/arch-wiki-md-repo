This article lists [domain name system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system "wikipedia:Domain name system") (DNS) services that may replace an internet service provider's DNS service. To use one of these servers, see [Domain name resolution](/index.php/Domain_name_resolution "Domain name resolution").

## Cisco Umbrella (formerly OpenDNS)

[OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) provided free alternative nameservers, was [bought by Cisco in Nov. 2016](https://umbrella.cisco.com/products/features/opendns-cisco-umbrella) and continues to offer OpenDNS as end-user product of its "Umbrella" product suite with focus on Security Enforcement, Security Intelligence and Web Filtering. The old nameservers [still work](https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/) but are [pre-configured to block adult content](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/):

```
208.67.222.222
208.67.220.220
2620:0:ccc::2
2620:0:ccd::2

```

## Cloudflare

[Cloudflare](https://1.1.1.1/) provides a service committed to never writing the querying IP addresses to disk and wiping all logs within 24 hours, with the exception of providing data to APNIC labs for research purposes. APNIC and Cloudfare committed to treat all data with high privacy standards in their [research agreement statement](https://labs.apnic.net/?p=1127).

```
1.1.1.1
1.0.0.1
2606:4700:4700::1111
2606:4700:4700::1001

```

## Comodo

[Comodo](https://securedns.dnsbycomodo.com/) provides another IPv4 set, with optional (non-free) web-filtering. Implied in this feature is that the service hijacks the queries.

```
8.26.56.26 
8.20.247.20

```

## DNS.WATCH

[DNS.WATCH](https://dns.watch/) focuses on neutrality and security and provides two servers located in Germany with no logging and with DNSSEC enabled. Note they welcome commercial sponsorship.

```
84.200.69.80                # resolver1.dns.watch 
84.200.70.40                # resolver2.dns.watch
2001:1608:10:25::1c04:b12f  # resolver1.dns.watch
2001:1608:10:25::9249:d69b  # resolver2.dns.watch

```

## Google

[Google's nameservers](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) can be used as an alternative:

```
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
2001:4860:4860::8888
2001:4860:4860::8844

```

## OpenNIC

[OpenNIC](https://www.opennic.org/) provides free uncensored nameservers located in multiple countries. The full list of public servers is available at [servers.opennic.org](https://servers.opennic.org/) and a shortlist of nearest nameservers for optimal performance is generated on their [home page](https://www.opennic.org/).

To retrieve a list of nearest nameservers, an [API](https://wiki.opennic.org/api/geoip) is also available and returns, based on the [URL parameters](https://wiki.opennic.org/api/geoip#url_parameters) provided, a list of nameservers in the desired format. For example to get the 200 nearest IPv4 servers, one can use [https://api.opennicproject.org/geoip/?list&ipv=4&res=200&adm=0&bl&wl](https://api.opennicproject.org/geoip/?list&ipv=4&res=200&adm=0&bl&wl).

Alternatively, the anycast servers below can be used; while reliable their latency [fluctuates a lot](https://wiki.opennic.org/opennic/dont_anycast).

Worldwide Anycast:

```
185.121.177.177
169.239.202.202
2a05:dfc7:5::53
2a05:dfc7:5::5353

```

**Note:** The use of OpenNIC DNS servers will allow host name resolution in the traditional Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries, but also in OpenNIC or afiliated operated namespaces: *.o*, *.libre*, *.dyn*...

**Tip:** The tool **opennic-up** â€” automates the renewal of the DNS servers with the most responsive OpenNIC servers

## Quad9

[Quad9](https://quad9.net/) is a free DNS service founded by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/security), [Packet Clearing House](https://www.pch.net) and [Global Cyber Alliance](https://www.globalcyberalliance.org); its primary unique feature is a blocklist which avoids resolving known malicious domains. The addresses below are worldwide anycast.

"Secure", with blocklist and DNSSEC:

```
9.9.9.9
149.112.112.112
2620:fe::fe
2620:fe::9

```

No blocklist, no DNSSEC:

```
9.9.9.10
149.112.112.10
2620:fe::10

```

## UncensoredDNS

[UncensoredDNS](https://censurfridns.dk) is a free uncensored DNS service. It is run by a private individual and consists in one anycast served by multiple servers and one unicast node hosted in Denmark.

```
91.239.100.100   # anycast.censurfridns.dk
89.233.43.71     # unicast.censurfridns.dk
2001:67c:28a4::  # anycast.censurfridns.dk
2a01:3a0:53:53:: # unicast.censurfridns.dk

```

**Note:** Its servers listen to port 5353 as well as the standard port 53\. This can be used in case your ISP hijacks port 53.

## Yandex

[Yandex.DNS](https://dns.yandex.com/advanced/) has servers in Russia, Eastern and Western Europe and has three options, *Basic*, *Safe* and *Family*.

Basic - no traffic filtering:

```
77.88.8.8
77.88.8.1
2a02:6b8::feed:0ff
2a02:6b8:0:1::feed:0ff

```

Safe - protection from infected and fraudulent sites:

```
77.88.8.88
77.88.8.2
2a02:6b8::feed:bad
2a02:6b8:0:1::feed:bad

```

Family - protection from dangerous sites and sites with adult content:

```
77.88.8.7
77.88.8.3
2a02:6b8::feed:a11
2a02:6b8:0:1::feed:a11

```
