The Forth computer language was invented by Charles Moore: [http://colorforth.com/](http://colorforth.com/)

Forth is extensible, can be its own OS, and in general makes tiny powerful programs.

Forth has been a recognized programming language since the 1970's. ColorForth is a redesign of this classic language for the 21st century. It also draws upon a 20-year evolution of minimal instruction-set microprocessors. Now implemented on modern PCs, it runs stand-alone without an operating system. Applications are recompiled from source with a simple optimizing compiler.

[gforth](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gforth/) is a forth that runs on an OS, and is ANSI Forth.

*Starting Forth* is a good book to learn forth by Leo Brodie: [http://home.iae.nl/users/mhx/sf.html](http://home.iae.nl/users/mhx/sf.html)
