The [Forth](http://colorforth.com/) computer language was invented by Charles Moore. Forth is extensible, can be its own operating system (OS), and in general makes tiny powerful programs. Forth has been a recognized programming language since the 1970's. ColorForth is a redesign of this classic language for the 21st century. It may run stand-alone without an operating system. Applications are recompiled from source with a simple optimizing compiler.
