This page describes troubleshooting and configuration specific to the **Asus A6km** laptop.

On this model, a known buggy BIOS problem results in a system hang when any USB device, such as a mouse, is attached at bootup. This can be fixed using a downgraded BIOS version (can be downloaded [here](http://people.bath.ac.uk/enxspd/laptop/Opensuse103_Laptop.html)). The installation described uses this 202 BIOS version and so far no problems have been encountered, even the power management modules behave properly.

See the [Beginners' guide](/index.php/Beginners%27_guide "Beginners' guide") for installation instructions.

```

## Wireless

For wireless, can use the b43-fwcutter package to install the firmware, (run _lsmod_ command to check if the b43 module is running):

```
# b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware /path_to_driver

```

the driver can be found [here](http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43)

## Audio

The sound card [SiS AC'97] was detected on installation and the correct modules for audio loaded at bootup.

See [ALSA](/index.php/ALSA "ALSA") for installation/configuration details.

## Touchpad

See [Touchpad Synaptics](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics "Touchpad Synaptics").

## Webcam

The webcam was detected on installation and the modules loaded at bootup.

```
Linux video capture interface: v2.00
stkwebcam: Syntek USB2.0 Camera is now controlling video device /dev/video0

```

The cheese webcam package worked well with the installed drivers. Cheese is installed with Gnome extras packages.

## Modem

Not tested so far

## IrDA

First make sure the device is enabled in the BIOS, then once booted up, start the daemon:

```
# /etc/rc.d/irda start

```

One way to test the device is to install the utilities:

```
# pacman -S irda-utils

```

and run the command:

```
# irdadump

```

the output should look something like this when working:

```
13:13:59.173537 xid:cmd 851b3728 > ffffffff S=6 s=0 (14) 
13:13:59.263432 xid:cmd 851b3728 > ffffffff S=6 s=1 (14)

13:13:59.443431 xid:cmd 851b3728 > ffffffff S=6 s=3 (14) 
13:13:59.533395 xid:cmd 851b3728 > ffffffff S=6 s=4 (14) 
13:13:59.626729 xid:rsp 851b3728 < 26098ceb S=6 s=4 Sony Ericss hint=9124 [ PnP Modem IrCOMM  IrOBEX ] (28)

13:13:59.723433 xid:cmd 851b3728 > ffffffff S=6 s=* asus-archlinux-64 hint=0400 [ Computer ] (33) 

```

The 'Sony Ericss' entry is a nearby (direct line of sight) mobile phone with infra-red enabled.

There should also be an **irda0** entry when running the `# ip a` command.

## Card Reader

Not tested so far

## Tv Out

Not tested.
