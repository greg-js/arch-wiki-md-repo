## Special Notes (*):

### Lenovo U31-70

Wireless needs [linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux) >= 4.3 and latest [linux-firmware](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux-firmware), both packages are currently in testing. Copy one of the firmware blobs `eeprom_ar6320_2p1_NFA345i.bin` or `eeprom_ar6320_2p1_NFA345i_highTX.bin` from the windows driver to `/usr/lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/board-pci-168c:0041:17aa:3545.bin`.

Wireless with firmware blobs from windows driver may no longer work on [linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux) >= 4.4\. Download firmware blob [https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/blob/f428f53b36b144971c9c4c3d2ebd5fa8cae86c89/QCA6174/hw2.1/board-2.bin](https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/blob/f428f53b36b144971c9c4c3d2ebd5fa8cae86c89/QCA6174/hw2.1/board-2.bin) and copy it to `/usr/lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA6174/hw2.1/board-2.bin`. Tested with [linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux) 4.4.5-1 and [linux-firmware](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux-firmware) 20160113.40e9ae8-1nu

With packages [linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux) 4.6.1-2 and [linux-firmware](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux-firmware) 20160516.80d463b-1 being in stable, wireless works without any additional steps needed.

### Lenovo B50-70

*   UEFI:
    *   to be able to disable Secure Boot (necessary for dual boot, not needed for Linux only), you have to switch from "UEFI first" to "UEFI only" (or something like this) in UEFI setup menu; the Secure Boot option appears then on the Security tab
    *   after UEFI update having Linux and Windows installed, the Linux bootloader ceased to be the default one, UEFI started to load Windows by default and it was impossible to select the Linux one in the UEFI boot menu and in the UEFI setup - reinstalling the bootloader helped; having no access to a boot media that supports UEFI, a solution might be also replacing the Windows EFI bootloader file with a Linux one temporalily, in order to be able to boot Linux from HDD
    *   for the UEFI update, a Windows OS is needed
*   Touchpad:
    *   Synaptics - works after installing Synaptics drivers from repo, possible to change behaviour (like reaction for double tap) according to your wish
*   Video:
    *   in laptops with dual video card (Intel and ATI) - detects both, Intel is active as a default, not checked if it's possible at all to switch between them

#### Operation with a HDD caddy

When you install an SSD in the place of the plate HDD drive and you want to have your HDD still inside the laptop, it is possible to install it in the place of the optical drive in a special "HDD caddy". The optical drive is of 9 mm height, but a 9,5 mm caddy (ultra slim) fits in the slot. A caddy with a SATA interface is needed. It is difficult to separate the front bezel from the original optical drive (and opening its case does not help, but brings a danger of making a mess in the opening mechanism; the only option is just to pull the bezel using a bit of force, but you risk breaking the latches).

While the HDD installed instead of the optical drive operates flawlessly in Windows, it wasn't going to work out of the box in Linux, at least in one case. The kernel tries to establish a connection with the disk, but fails to do it (*SATA link down* entry in /var/log/messages). The solution is to force a 1.5 Gbps transfer speed (instead of 6 Gbps) by adding a *libata.force=* kernel parameter. See [[1]](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt) for details.

### Lenovo K450e

After installing Arch Linux and booting, a single beep may be heard. To disable this beep, press F1 during startup, then change Boot Priority to 'UEFI First', as well as enabling 'CSM'.

### ThinkPad X1 Carbon 3rd

*   [http://natalian.org/archives/2015/02/18/Archlinux_on_a_Lenovo_X1C3/](http://natalian.org/archives/2015/02/18/Archlinux_on_a_Lenovo_X1C3/)

### IBM ThinkPad T21

*   Video:
    *   Incapable of running DRM at 1024x768 and 24-bit color due to 8 MB VRAM. Must drop color or resolution to get DRM.
    *   For whatever reason, external VGA output (for an external monitor) was disabled. This was fixed by doing this:
        *   `echo 1 > /proc/acpi/video/VID/DOS`

### Lenovo 3000 N200

*   Sound:
    *   You may have to append `options snd_hda_intel model=lenovo` to `/etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf` for sound to work.

### IBM ThinkPad R52

*   USB network tethering
    *   Inbound networking via interface *usb0* works.

### Lenovo ThinkPad T430

*   The volume mute works fine, but the led is simply toggled by the press. No relation to the actual mute state. (aka. if you start with the system muted and the led off, pressing it will unmute the volume, but turn on the led).
*   The microphone mute button works, but the led stays lit permanently.
*   Bluetooth (0a5c:21e6 Broadcom Corp. BCM20702 Bluetooth 4.0 [ThinkPad]) appears to be functional, even during standby or hibernation.

### Lenovo ThinkPad T440p

*   ClickPad: the whole trackpad clicks, and disabling the trackpad using older versions of synclient makes the trackpoint essentially unusable. This has been resolved in newer versions of [xf86-input-synaptics](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-synaptics).
    *   See [this article](http://who-t.blogspot.com.au/2014/03/xorg-synaptics-support-for-lenovo-t440.html) and [previous version](http://who-t.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/lenovo-t440-touchpad-button.html).
    *   Install [xf86-input-synlx40](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xf86-input-synlx40/) and [xf86-input-mtrack](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xf86-input-mtrack/) for alternative drivers.
*   Audio:
    *   HDMI audio is the default audio output device. Consult the [ALSA](/index.php/ALSA "ALSA") page for details on changing the default.
    *   As the X100e/Mini10, it's possible to mute the headset and speaker outputs separately to the master. Muting the speaker output improves bass output on the headset port.
    *   If the system fails to wake from sleep, it can lose sync with the internal audio card and speakers/headphones may fail to work. In this case, put the system to sleep, and wake it again and audio functionality should be restored.
*   The fingerprint sensor is a Validity VFS5011, which requires [a patched fprintd](https://github.com/abbradar/fprint_vfs5011) and is apparently highly unreliable.
*   thinkpad_acpi:
    *   Controlling the Fn-Lock, Mute, Mic Mute or 'glowing I' LEDs is apparently not possible.
    *   fan control does not seem to work.
*   Graphics and Video:
    *   With the integrated GPU, [xrandr](/index.php/Xrandr "Xrandr") can crash while attaching or detaching displays connected via the dock.
    *   The built-in miniDisplayPort will sometimes spew I²C issues into the kernel log.
    *   [Hardware video acceleration](/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration "Hardware video acceleration") is highly recommended as it performs significantly better than CPU decoding of large media files.
    *   **The BIOS should not be upgraded past version 1.14, as newer BIOSes cause memory corruption when used with Bumblebee.** See [Bumblebee GitHub](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch/issues/78#issuecomment-42741698)
*   Connectivity:
    *   Bluetooth is *extremely* fragile. The controller works fine most of the time, but can cause the system to wedge totally on sleep/wake cycles, especially if a connection was active at sleep. Disable the controller using `bluetoothctl` before sleeping.

### Lenovo S21e-20

*   Tested with [broadcom-wl-dkms](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/broadcom-wl-dkms/) 802.11 wireless driver
*   Synaptics touchpad required 3 patches to [linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux):drivers/hid/hid-rmi.c on 2015-07-26 ([bug report](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91102), [kernel recipe patch](https://github.com/harisokanovic/archlinux-packages/commit/f4550c211ca7809ecf926f8074c7b7250a74bd92)). The current 4.3 kernel includes these patches. You will also need to install the xf86_64-input-synaptics package([[2]](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-synaptics))

#### tpacpi-bat

There is an issue with tpacpi-bat not reporting the right value for the stop threshold. This seems to be related to a buggy BIOS and can not be fixed application wise.

See [https://github.com/teleshoes/tpacpi-bat/issues/44](https://github.com/teleshoes/tpacpi-bat/issues/44)

#### ThinkPad Edge E420s Delay with Space Bar

Solution: Update BIOS (at least 1.08).
