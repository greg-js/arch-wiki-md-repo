[ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ "wikipedia:ICQ") is a cross-platform instant messaging and videotelephony service. ICQ has been around since 1996, one of the longest running instant messengers out there. It requires an SMS-enabled mobile cell number in order to register as a new user, even on desktop (this was not the case in the older days).

The desktop version of ICQ (including on Windows and macOS) is open source (see [GitHub](https://github.com/mailru/icqdesktop)).
