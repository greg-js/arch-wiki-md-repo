[ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ "wikipedia:ICQ") is a cross-platform instant messaging and videotelephony service. ICQ has been around since 1996, one of the longest running instant messengers out there.

ICQ can be used in a client by logging in with the user's given UIN code, or e-mail address (if given). However, currently (as of 2019) it requires an SMS-enabled mobile cell number in order to register as a new user, even on desktop (this was not the case in the older days). After registration and receiving a UIN, the user may choose to add an e-mail address, which can also be used in place of the UIN to log in. It is also possible to log in with the mobile number, but this would always require an SMS confirmation code everytime and thus is unhandy.

The desktop version of ICQ (including on Windows and macOS) is open source (see [GitHub](https://github.com/mailru/icqdesktop)).
