[ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ "wikipedia:ICQ") is a cross-platform instant messaging and videotelephony service. ICQ has been around since 1996, one of the longest running instant messengers out there.

ICQ can be used in a client by logging in with the user's given UIN code. Currently as of 2019, newly registering users of the service require an SMS-enabled mobile cell number for confirmation. Since the recent introduction of the new WIM protocol, an e-mail address (if given during registration) can also be used in place of the UIN to log in. The registered cell number can also be used to login, but this would require an SMS confirmation code every time so is not recommended.

The desktop version of ICQ (including on Windows and macOS) is open source (see [GitHub](https://github.com/mailru/icqdesktop)).

## Installation

You can use one of following methods in order to use ICQ in Arch:

(please note that ICQ's [OSCAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSCAR_protocol) protocol is depreciated and replaced by WIM - you should check if third-party clients support the new protocol instead of the old one. OSCAR still functions (as of March 2019) but it is highly recommended to make use of the new WIM instead):
