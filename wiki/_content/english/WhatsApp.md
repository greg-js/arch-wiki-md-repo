[WhatsApp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp "wikipedia:WhatsApp") is a mobile-first instant messaging service owned by Facebook, featuring end-to-end encryption. It requires an active cell phone number and data connection to operate.

There is no official WhatsApp desktop client for Linux, and Facebook has strictly attempted to ban third-party clients and plugins using their protocol. Due to this corporate behaviour, we recommend people to avoid using WhatsApp altogether in favor of IM services with more openness, such as [XMPP](/index.php/XMPP "XMPP"), [Telegram](/index.php/Telegram "Telegram") or [ICQ](/index.php/ICQ "ICQ").

## Installation

You can use one of following methods in order to use WhatsApp in Arch:

### Web-based clients

*   [whatsapp-nativefier](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/whatsapp-nativefier/), a desktop wrapper of WhatsApp Web built using nativefier.
*   [franz](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/franz/), an open-source Chrome-based application that can be used for web-based interface of various instant messaging software including WhatsApp.
*   [rambox-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rambox-bin/), like Franz, a web-based wrapper for various instant messaging software including WhatsApp.

### Graphical clients
