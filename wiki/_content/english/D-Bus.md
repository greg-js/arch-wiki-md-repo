[D-Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus "wikipedia:D-Bus") is a message bus system that provides an easy way for inter-process communication. It consists of a daemon, which can be run both system-wide and for each user session, and a set of libraries to allow applications to use D-Bus.

[dbus](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dbus) is pulled and installed as a dependency of [systemd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=systemd) and user session bus is [started automatically](https://www.archlinux.org/news/d-bus-now-launches-user-buses/) for each user.
