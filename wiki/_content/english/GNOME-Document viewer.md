[Document viewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evince "w:Evince") is specifically designed to support the file following formats: PDF, Postscript, djvu, tiff, dvi, XPS, SyncTex support with gedit, comics books (cbr,cbz,cb7 and cbt). For a comprehensive list of formats supported, see [Supported Document Formats](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince/SupportedDocumentFormats).

Document viewer uses the poppler library as a backend.

**Note:** Document viewer was previously known as [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince) until the application was given new descriptive names, one for each supported language. The name *Evince* is still used in numerous places such as the executable name, some package names, some desktop entries, and some GSettings schemas.
