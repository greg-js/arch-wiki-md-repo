## Manually

There are two methods for spoofing a MAC address using either [iproute2](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=iproute2) (installed by default) or [macchanger](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=macchanger) (available on the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories")). Both of them are outlined below.

### Method 1: iproute2

First, you can check your current MAC address with the command:

```
# ip link show *interface*

```

where `*interface*` is the name of your [network interface](/index.php/Network_interface "Network interface").

The section that interests us at the moment is the one that has "link/ether" followed by a 6-byte number. It will probably look something like this:

```
link/ether 00:1d:98:5a:d1:3a

```

The first step to spoofing the MAC address is to bring the network interface down. It can be accomplished with the command:

```
# ip link set dev *interface* down

```

Next, we actually spoof our MAC. Any hexadecimal value will do, but some networks may be configured to refuse to assign IP addresses to a client whose MAC does not match up with any of known vendors. Therefore, unless you control the network(s) you are connecting to, use MAC prefix of any real vendor (basically, the first three bytes), and use random values for next three bytes. For more information please read [Wikipedia:Organizationally unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizationally_unique_identifier "wikipedia:Organizationally unique identifier").

To change the MAC, we need to run the command:

```
# ip link set dev *interface* address *XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX*

```

Where any 6-byte value will suffice for `*XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX*`.

The final step is to bring the network interface back up. This can be accomplished by running the command:

```
# ip link set dev *interface* up

```

If you want to verify that your MAC has been spoofed, simply run `ip link show *interface*` again and check the value for 'link/ether'. If it worked, 'link/ether' should be whatever address you decided to change it to.

### Method 2: macchanger

Another method uses [macchanger](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=macchanger) (a.k.a., the GNU MAC Changer). It provides a variety of features such as changing the address to match a certain vendor or completely randomizing it.

[Install](/index.php/Pacman#Installing_specific_packages "Pacman") the package [macchanger](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=macchanger) from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

The spoofing is done on per-interface basis, specify [network interface](/index.php/Network_interface "Network interface") name as `*interface*` in each of the following commands.

The MAC address can be spoofed with a fully random address:

```
# macchanger -r *interface*

```

To randomize only device-specific bytes of current MAC address (that is, so that if the MAC address was checked it would still register as being from the same vendor), you would run the command:

```
# macchanger -e *interface*

```

To change the MAC address to a specific value, you would run:

```
# macchanger --mac=*XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX* *interface*

```

Where `*XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX*` is the MAC you wish to change to.

Finally, to return the MAC address to its original, permanent hardware value:

```
# macchanger -p *interface*

```

**Note:** A device cannot be in use (connected in any way or with its interface up) while the MAC address is being changed.

## Automatically

### Method 1: systemd-networkd

[systemd-networkd](/index.php/Systemd-networkd "Systemd-networkd") supports MAC address spoofing via [link files](/index.php/Systemd-networkd#link_files "Systemd-networkd") (see `man systemd.link` for details).

To set a static spoofed MAC address:

 `/etc/systemd/network/00-default.link` 
```
[Match]
MACAddress=*original MAC*

[Link]
MACAddress=*spoofed MAC*
NamePolicy=kernel database onboard slot path
```

To randomize the MAC address on every boot, set `MACAddressPolicy=random` instead of `MACAddress=*spoofed MAC*`.

### Method 2: systemd-udevd

[Udev](/index.php/Udev "Udev") allows you to perform MAC address spoofing by creating the [udev rule](/index.php/Udev#Writing_udev_rules "Udev"). Use `address` attribute to match the correct device by its original MAC address and change it using the *ip* command:

 `/etc/udev/rules.d/75-mac-spoof.rules`  `ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="net", ATTR{address}=="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX", RUN+="/usr/bin/ip link set devÂ %k address YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY"` 

where `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` is the original MAC address and `YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY` is the new one.

### Method 3: systemd unit

#### Creating unit

Below you find two examples of [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") units to change a MAC address at boot, one sets a static MAC using *ip* and one uses *macchanger* to assign a random MAC address. The systemd `network-pre.target` is used to ensure the MAC is changed before a network manager like [Netctl](/index.php/Netctl "Netctl") or [NetworkManager](/index.php/NetworkManager "NetworkManager"), [systemd-networkd](/index.php/Systemd-networkd "Systemd-networkd") or [dhcpcd](/index.php/Dhcpcd "Dhcpcd") service starts.

##### iproute2

[systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") unit setting a predefined MAC address:

 `/etc/systemd/system/macspoof@.service` 
```
[Unit]
Description=MAC Address Change %I
Wants=network-pre.target
Before=network-pre.target
BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-%i.device
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-%i.device

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ip link set dev %i address 36:aa:88:c8:75:3a
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ip link set dev %i up

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

##### macchanger

[systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") unit setting a random address while preserving the original NIC vendor bytes. Ensure that [macchanger](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=macchanger) is [installed](/index.php/Pacman#Installing_specific_packages "Pacman"):

 `/etc/systemd/system/macspoof@.service` 
```
[Unit]
Description=macchanger on %I
Wants=network-pre.target
Before=network-pre.target
BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-%i.device
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-%i.device

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/macchanger -e %I
Type=oneshot

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

A full random address can be set using the `-r` option, see [#Method 2: macchanger](#Method_2:_macchanger).

#### Enabling service

Append the desired network interface to the service name (e.g. `eth0`) and [enable](/index.php/Enable "Enable") the service (e.g. `macspoof@eth0.service`).

Reboot, or stop and start the prerequisite and requisite services in the proper order. If you are in control of your network, verify that the spoofed MAC has been picked up by your router by examining the static, or DHCP address tables within the router.

### Method 4: netctl interfaces

You can use a [netctl hook](/index.php/Netctl#Using_hooks "Netctl") to run a command each time a netctl profile is re-/started for a specific network interface. Replace `*interface*` accordingly:

 `/etc/netctl/interfaces/*interface*` 
```
#!/usr/bin/env sh
/usr/bin/macchanger -r *interface*
```

Make the script executable:

```
chmod +x /etc/netctl/interfaces/*interface*

```

### Method 5: NetworkManager

See [NetworkManager#Configuring MAC Address Randomization](/index.php/NetworkManager#Configuring_MAC_Address_Randomization "NetworkManager").

## Troubleshooting

### Connection to DHCPv4 network fails

If you cannot connect to a DHCPv4 network and you are using dhcpcd, which is the default for NetworkManager, you might need to [modify the dhcpcd configuration](/index.php/Dhcpcd#Client_ID "Dhcpcd") to obtain a lease.
