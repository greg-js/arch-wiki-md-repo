## Installation

### Basics

Installation needs a bit of workarounds ( as of 2018.12 arch iso ).

First you will need to disable secureboot in BIOS (ESC to bring up menu, then F10 for BIOS and/or F9 for Boot options).

Using bios F.08 I somehow had to enable legacy boot support to be able to boot even if using UEFI ( this may be a side effect of testing many things, needs to be clarified ).

Upon boot, you need to edit the kernel cmdline ( press e in UEFI mode when presented with the list of boot options on the arch USB key ) and remove the first initrd lines mentionning intel and amd.

Then follow the [installation guide](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide") as usual.

### Advanced / Kernel update

If you want to have support for the digital mic, sleep mode s2idle and working rotation, you can also try compiling the kernel at [[1]](https://github.com/gled-rs/linux-hp_ap0xxx)

## Issues / Notes

### Audio

The laptop has a Realtek ALC285 Codec with a 4 speaker system built in. External mic with headphones works and legacy driver plays only on two speakers.

For the internal dual digital mic, it currently does not work with the legacy driver ( snd-hda-intel ) but works using snd-sof as described in the kernel bug [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201251#c73](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201251#c73) . Hopefully will be merged fully by kernel 5.3-5.4 and will allow using the microphone.

There is still work needed to support the 4 speakers.

### Camera

The camera is detected as a standard UVC device. The hardware switch works without issue to enable/disable it.

### Mute Button

All the media keys works. The mute button does not light up though.

### Auto Rotation

Installing [iio-sensor-proxy](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=iio-sensor-proxy) and [screenrotator-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/screenrotator-git/) autorotation works out of the box.

You can also use this script [[2]](https://gist.github.com/Migacz85/3f544933ce5add438555ba7cd33f0413) but you have to change the line TOUCHPAD="ELAN Touchscreen" by PEN="ELAN2514:00 04F3:280E Pen (0)" and change everywhere the word TOUCHPAD by the word PEN. Indeed, the touchpad do not need to be remaped, since it is deactivated when the screen is rotated, however the PEN is.

WARNING sensor support is broken in 5.0+ kernels because of a kernel bug floating around that cause issues and error messages to be spammed. A simple fix is [https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/8/2](https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/8/2) ( that patch got reverted in the current 5.2+ kernels, but can be reapplied safely ).

### Dual boot

Works without issues. You can resize the windows partition if you want to keep the stock windows 10 setup from HP ( do not forget to bcdedit the device and osdevice if you follow a linux guide to repartitionning the ntfs drive. You will need to disabled bitlocker also to be able to use the drive ).

### Hp "sureview" privacy screen

Works out of the box. May seem a bit too bright/white for meÂ ? Never had a sureview before so no comparison points available. Windows test after testing linux seems to exhibit same behavior.

### USB-C HDMI-out / dualscreen

Works out of the box with a generic USB-C to HDMI adapter

### Bluetooth

Works out of the box.

### Mobile Broadband

Some configurations include the [Intel XMM 7560](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wireless-products/mobile-communications/xmm-7560-brief.html) 4G LTE modem, an updated version of [the 7360 with no Linux kernel driver](https://superuser.com/a/1337418).

`lspci` lists the module as:

```
01:00.0 Wireless controller [0d40]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:7560] (rev 01)
	Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device [103c:8507]

```

### Fingerprint Reader

Not supported at the moment in libfprint, there seems to be a beginning of work to support those types of fingerprint readers here: [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/vincenth/libfprint.git](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/vincenth/libfprint.git) The branch synaptics-driver-20190617 contains code that seems to be able to open the fingerprint reader ( if you add the correct device id in drivers/synaptics/synaptics.c ) .

Generates an error after opening though so this is not complete yet.

### Tablet mode

Keyboard is automatically deactivated when screen is rotated to tent or tablet mode. Screen-rotator works great. Using Onboard for onscreen keyboard works also, but xfce4 does not allow Onboard to come automatically when editing text ( Onboard uses the Gnome accessibility, so if you are a Gnome user, you should be fine ).

### IR Camera Login

Works with [Howdy](/index.php/Howdy "Howdy") configured to use /dev/video2 and the patch referenced in [https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/issues/70#issuecomment-439123621](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy/issues/70#issuecomment-439123621)

### Battery optimizations

tlp installed, no customisations: around 8-12h of browsing / sysadmin work, depending on the tasks. (Please, see next section, since tlp messes up with suspend).

Powertop display a constant mW consumption of 570 mW ( probably wrong ). There is a setting in the BIOS to allow reporting via ACPI of the battery remaining time. It is disabled by default => to investigate.

### Suspend issues

This model only supports the S0ix, and so only S0 (s2idle) sleep mode is activated. Since this device use a Hynix SSD, it is affected by a bug [[3]](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1801875), resulting in 4-5% battery drain per hour during suspend. A patch set is available, but will not be merged [[4]](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1007283/). In any case, you can install the patched kernel from AUR [linux-hynix](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-hynix/). The battery drain during suspend should drop to 1-2% per hour.

As it is mentioned by Intel [[5]](https://01.org/blogs/qwang59/2018/how-achieve-s0ix-states-linux), TLP may not work, and so it should not be used with S0ix.
