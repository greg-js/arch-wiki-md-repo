# Adding Packages to Extra

Because we have limited man power, and limited mirror space, it is important that we keep the packages in the [extra] repository under control. Packages can always go into community as opposed to extra.

### Ask First

The policy here is very simple. Ask the other devs.

*   Send a short mail to the arch-dev-public list with your intent to add a new package to [extra]
*   Wait for a few replies to see if anyone takes issue with it. Generally, it's probably good to wait a few hours, as timezones differ between the team quite a bit.
*   Assuming no one takes issue with the package, add it to extra.
