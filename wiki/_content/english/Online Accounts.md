This page is for listing and explaining of online account integration. Online account integration is subject to different [desktop envrionment]s and/or different packages.

## KDE

KDE plasma has a [page](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Workspace/WebAccounts) briefly explaining its online account integration function. Though described in one place, the user experience of that is split into two parts: KDE PIM (through Akonadi) and the KCM *Online Account* section (including online chatting through telepathy).

### PIM

See [KDE#PIM](/index.php/KDE#PIM "KDE")

### Online Account

The KCM *Online Account* section provides a unified place to configure connections to some online accounts. It also provides integration with empathy online chatting.

By default, the *Online Account* section doesn't have much to do, unless you install respected modules (packages).

Here is an (incomplete) list of relevant packages:

*   [kaccounts-providers](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=kaccounts-providers) (basic functions)
*   [kio-gdrive](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=kio-gdrive) (Google Drive integration)
*   [telepathy-kde-accounts-kcm](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=telepathy-kde-accounts-kcm) (online chatting)
