[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is an ambitious new ecosystem for open federated instant messaging and VoIP. It consists of servers, clients and bridge software to connect to existing messaging solutions like IRC.

## Installation

The reference server implementation **Synapse** is available in the community repository as [matrix-synapse](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=matrix-synapse). Synapse does not run on Python 3 and requires version 2.7\. The community package creates a *synapse* user.

## Configuration

After installation, a configuration file needs to be generated. It should be readable by the *synapse* user:

```
$ cd /var/lib/synapse
$ sudo -u synapse python2 -m synapse.app.homeserver \
  --server-name my.domain.name \
  --config-path /etc/synapse/homeserver.yaml \
  --generate-config \
  --report-stats=yes

```

Note that this will generate corresponding SSL keys and self-signed certificates for the specified server name. You have to regenerate those if you change the server name.

### Webclient

The default synapse configuration enables the webclient feature. Unless you have [python2-matrix-angular-sdk](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python2-matrix-angular-sdk) installed this will make synapse fail to start. Either disable it, or install [python2-matrix-angular-sdk](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python2-matrix-angular-sdk).

**Note:** From the [developers website:](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/matrix-console.html) Matrix.orgâ€™s original reference AngularJS webclient has major performance issues and is not being actively maintained. Please see Riot and matrix-react-sdk for better alternatives.

**Note:** There is a bug with disabling the web_client. You need to edit multiple lines, see the issue [https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2113](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2113)

## Service

A systemd service named *synapse.service* will be installed by the matrix-synapse package. It will start the synapse server as user *synapse* and use the configuration file `/etc/synapse/homeserver.yaml`.

## User management

You need at least one user on your fresh synapse server. You may create one as your normal non-root user with the command

 `$ register_new_matrix_user -c /etc/synapse/homeserver.yaml [https://localhost:8448](https://localhost:8448)` 

or using one of the [matrix clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html)

## Spider Webcrawler

To enable the webcrawler, for server generated link previews, the additional packages [python2-lxml](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python2-lxml) and [python2-netaddr](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python2-netaddr) have to be installed. After that the config option `url_preview_enabled: True` can be set in your `homeserver.yaml`. To prevent the synapse server from issuing arbitrary GET requests to internal hosts the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist:` has to be set.

**Warning:** There are no defaults! By default the synapse server can crawl all your internal hosts.

There are some examples that can be uncommented. Add your local IP ranges to that list to prevent the synapse server from trying to crawl them. After changing the `homeserver.yaml` the service has to be restarted.
