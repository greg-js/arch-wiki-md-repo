[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), formerly known as Atom Shell, is an application developed by GitHub to build cross platform desktop apps using web technologies. The most famous example of desktop apps built on Electron is the [Atom](/index.php/Atom "Atom") text editor.

## Installation

Electron can be installed with either:

*   the [electron](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=electron) package or
*   the *electron* package from the unofficial [atom](/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#atom "Unofficial user repositories") repository, which uses a different [build method](https://github.com/tensor5/arch-atom/blob/master/README.md#build-method).
