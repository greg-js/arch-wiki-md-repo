This article covers hardware specific configuration of this laptop, some minor issues remain after customization. These can be performed after an installation of Arch Linux has been finished and the machine rebooted into it.

## Installation

Installing arch is straight forward for everything (disable secure boot, F10 for BIOS, F9 for boot options) but one thing: you may have to disable a BIOS option called "fast boot". While this option is activated in BIOS the machine may boot into Windows no matter what you select. If you make to boot into the latest arch ISO (June 2016) on a USB, arch EFI boot menu hangs. After you installed arch on HDD and moved all of M$ Windows to /dev/null, you may activate that option again. Although no difference in boot performance could be observed with the option activated or deactivated.

## Issues

### Audio

Codec has changed from the previous version, now it's Realtek ALC295:

```
# aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC295 Analog [ALC295 Analog]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

```

In best case scenario just one speaker is going to work. There's a bug for that: [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189331](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189331)

### Touchpad

When using synaptics X11 drivers touchpad works but fails to detect palm, which causes problems when typing. Dell XPS13 had similar issue and they fixed it, but HP is not going to do that. Refer to [https://github.com/advancingu/XPS13Linux/issues/3](https://github.com/advancingu/XPS13Linux/issues/3)

When using libinput drivers palm detection works out of the box.

### Multimedia keys

While the keyboard backlight (f5) and airplane mode (f12) keys work without any intervention, the rest of the fn keys will be nonfunctional out of the box (unless your DE/WM provides this functionality). In the case that it doesn't, this can be remedied with [acpid](/index.php/Acpid "Acpid"), allowing the screen brightness, volume, and multimedia back/play/forward keys to work.

Hardware names that the acpi event handler recognizes for these buttons are as follows:

 `$ journalctl -f` 
```
... ACPI group/action undefined: **video/brightnessdown** / BRTDN
... ACPI group/action undefined: **video/brightnessup** / BRTUP
... ACPI group/action undefined: **button/mute** / MUTE
... ACPI group/action undefined: **button/volumedown** / VOLDN
... ACPI group/action undefined: **button/volumeup** / VOLUP
... ACPI group/action undefined: **cd/prev** / CDPREV
... ACPI group/action undefined: **cd/play** / CDPLAY
... ACPI group/action undefined: **cd/next** / CDNEXT

```

Following the information and examples provided in [acpid#Tips_and_tricks](/index.php/Acpid#Tips_and_tricks "Acpid"), handlers can be put in `/etc/acpi/events/` to perform actions on all of these.

Alternatively, a quick solution to get screen backlight control working with the media keys is to use [xfce4-power-manager](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xfce4-power-manager), selecting `Handle display brightness keys` in the settings.

### Auto Rotation

See [Tablet_PC#Automatic_rotation](/index.php/Tablet_PC#Automatic_rotation "Tablet PC") for common methods of achieving this, as well as [here](https://github.com/tegan-lamoureux/Rotate-Spectre), for a python auto-rotation script specifically written for this laptop.
