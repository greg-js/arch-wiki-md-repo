## Installation

Installing arch is straight forward for everything (disable secure boot, F10 for BIOS, F9 for boot options) but one thing: you may have to disable a BIOS option called "fast boot". While this option is activated in BIOS the machine may boot into Windows no matter what you select. If you make to boot into the latest arch ISO (June 2016) on a USB, arch EFI boot menu hangs. After you installed arch on HDD and moved all of M$ Windows to /dev/null, you may activate that option again. Although no difference in boot performance could be observed with the option activated or deactivated.

## Issues

### Audio

Codec has changed from the previous version, now it's Realtek ALC295:

```
# aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC295 Analog [ALC295 Analog]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

```

In best case scenario just one speaker is going to work. There's a bug for that: [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189331](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189331)

### Touchpad

When using synaptics X11 drivers touchpad works but fails to detect palm, which causes problems when typing. Dell XPS13 had similar issue and they fixed it, but HP is not going to do that. Refer to [https://github.com/advancingu/XPS13Linux/issues/3](https://github.com/advancingu/XPS13Linux/issues/3)

When using libinput drivers palm detection works out of the box.
