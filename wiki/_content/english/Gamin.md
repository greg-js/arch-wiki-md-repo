[Gamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamin "wikipedia:Gamin") is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset of the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) system. It is a service provided by a library which allows for the detection of modification to a file or directory.

Gamin re-implements the [FAM](/index.php/FAM "FAM") specification with [inotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inotify "wikipedia:inotify"). It is newer and more actively maintained than FAM, maintains compatibility with FAM and can replace it in almost every case. It is a [GNOME](/index.php/GNOME "GNOME") project, but does not have GNOME dependencies.

## Installation
