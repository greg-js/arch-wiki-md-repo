## Troubleshooting

### Fingerprint reader

According to the [Fprint wiki](/index.php/Fprint "Fprint"), the reader does not appear to be a [supported model](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/libfprint/Supported_devices/). If the reader is unused, it is recommended that the device be physically disabled in the bios.

### Fan noise

Fan noise was an issue on initial BIOS revisions. The change log for BIOS version 1.08 noted a fan settings update which has since resolved the fan noise issue.
