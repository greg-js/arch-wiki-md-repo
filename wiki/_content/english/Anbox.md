Anbox is a free and open-source compatibility layer that aims to allow mobile applications and mobile games developed for Android to run on GNU/Linux distributions. It executes the Android runtime environment by using LXC (Linux Containers), recreating the directory structure of Android as a mountable loop image, whilst using the native Linux kernel to execute applications.
