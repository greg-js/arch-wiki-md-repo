From [wikipedia:3d mouse#3D mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_mouse#3D_mice "wikipedia:3d mouse"):

	Also known as bats, flying mice, or wands, these devices generally function through ultrasound and provide at least three degrees of freedom. Probably the best known example would be 3DConnexion/Logitech's SpaceMouse from the early 1990s.

**Note:** The following instructions have been tested and proven to work on the most basic model (Space Navigator).

## Proprietary drivers

1\. Plug your 3D mouse into your USB port. Use `lsusb` to check if it was recognised

```
$> lsusb
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:c626 Logitech, Inc. 3Dconnexion Space Navigator 3D Mouse
```

2\. Install [openmotif](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=openmotif).

3\. Symlink `libXm.so.4` to `libXm.so.3`

 `$> sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libXm.so.4 /usr/lib/libXm.so.3` 

4\. The driver has some problems to get the username from `/var/run/utmp` and will output a "failed to get user" error.

To fix this problem compile the following program. It appends the given username to `/var/run/utmp` in such a way that the driver can read it.

 `3dmouse.c` 
```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <utmpx.h>

int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Need a name to put in the structure
");
    exit(1);
  }
  struct utmpx u;
  memset(&u, 0, sizeof(u));
  u.ut_type = USER_PROCESS;
  u.ut_pid = getpid();
  strcpy(u.ut_id, ":0");
  strcpy(u.ut_line, ":0");
  strcpy(u.ut_user, argv[1]);
  setutxent();
  pututxline(&u);
  endutxent();
} 

```

```
$> gcc 3dmouse.c -o 3dmouse
$> sudo ./3dmouse root
```

5\. Download the linux drivers to `/tmp` from here: [https://www.3dconnexion.com/service/drivers.html](https://www.3dconnexion.com/service/drivers.html)

6\. Unpack the install script and run it

```
$> tar xfz 3dxware-linux-v1-5-2.i386.tar.gz install-3dxunix.sh
$> sudo ./install-3dxunix.sh

Do you want 3DxWareUnix being started with every login (from the /etc/inittab)? (y/n) [y]
n

Please start the driver manually. [/etc/3DxWare/daemon/3dxsrv -d <port>]

****************************************************************
    For testing purposes you can find the demos
                      xcube and xvalues at /tmp
****************************************************************

```

NOTE: I chose not to run the driver everytime I login.

7\. You can run the driver manually by calling it like this (for USB version):

 `$> sudo /etc/3DxWare/daemon/3dxsrv -d USB` 

8\. You should now have a working 3D mouse in Arch Linux! You can test it by extracting the demos from the driver archive.

```
$> tar xfz 3dxware-linux-v1-5-2.i386.tar.gz xcube
$> ./xcube
```

## Open Source Drivers

There exists also an open source driver for 3Dconnexion devices maintained by the spacenav project. Unfortunately the list of supported applications is very short. Actually there is only one major software supporting the spacenav driver, namely the 3D creation suite Blender. For it to work three things must be fulfilled

1.  The device must be recognized by the kernel as input device
2.  The spacenavd daemon must be running
3.  The application must be compiled with spacenav support. (community/[blender](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=blender) isn't)

The first requirement should be fulfilled automatically after plugging in the device. It can be checked by looking if the device is listed in `/proc/bus/input/devices` e.g. by

```
$> grep 3Dconnexion /proc/bus/input/devices
N: Name="3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator"
```

For the second point install [libspnav](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=libspnav) and [spacenavd](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spacenavd/) from AUR. For testing it is a good idea to start the daemon on foreground mode. The output should look similar to this:

```
$> sudo spacenavd -v -d
Spacenav daemon 0.5
Device detection, parsing /proc/bus/input/devices
using device: /dev/input/event21
device name: 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator
trying to open X11 display ":0"
   XAUTHORITY=/home/user/.Xauthority
```

If it works you can simply shut down the daemon by hitting CTRL-C and run it using `sudo /etc/rc.d/spacenavd start`. On a systemd-only system the following service script can be used to start the daemon with `sudo systemctl start spacenavd.service`

 `/etc/systemd/system/spacenavd.service` 
```
[Unit]
Description=Userspace Daemon of the spacenav driver.

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/spnavd.pid
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority
ExecStart=/usr/bin/spacenavd

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now everything is up and running and every supported application should be able to use the 3D Mouse.

### Blender with spacenav support

The [blender](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=blender) package in the community repository is now compiled with spacenav support by default.

However, if you wish to rebuild Blender with spacenav support manually, you can install [libspnav](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=libspnav) first and then rebuild blender from [ABS](/index.php/ABS "ABS"). It will automatically build with NDOF(=spacenav) support.

Now you can fire up blender and test your 3D Mouse.

```
$> blender
ndof: using SpaceNavigator
```
