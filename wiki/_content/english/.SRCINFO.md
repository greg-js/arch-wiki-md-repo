This article discusses the creation of and variables definable by the maintainer in a .SRCINFO. For information on the .SRCINFO functions and creating packages in general, refer to [Creating packages](/index.php/Creating_packages "Creating packages"). Also read `man .SRCINFO`.

`.SRCINFO` is a metadata file used in source tarballs to overwrite specific [PKGBUILD](/index.php/PKGBUILD "PKGBUILD") fields required by [Arch Linux](/index.php/Arch_Linux "Arch Linux") packages.

Maintainters can generate `.SRCINFO` files using:

```
$ makepkg --printsrcinfo

```

Which prints to standard output, or:

```
$ mksrcinfo

```

Provided by [pkgbuild-introspection](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=pkgbuild-introspection), which writes to the file `.SRCINFO`.

An outdated format of this file was described in the [AUR 2.1.0 release announcement](https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/aur-dev/2013-March/002428.html). `.SRCINFO` files are parsed line-by-line. The syntax for each line is `key[_arch] = value`. Exactly one space must be on each side of the equals sign, even for an empty value, and do not include quotes around the values.

**Warning:** Updates to packages require `.SRCINFO` to be regenerated. [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") packagers should be aware that uploads without changes to `.SRCINFO` *will be accepted*, causing discrepancies between the stale package information displayed on AUR and the actual package content.

## Manually setting keys

The `key` is a field name, based on the names of the corresponding [PKGBUILD Variables](/index.php/PKGBUILD_Variables "PKGBUILD Variables"). Some field names may optionally be suffixed with an architecture name. Fields are grouped into sections, each headed by one of the following two field names:

*   pkgbase: This is required by AUR 3, otherwise the infamous “only lowercase letters are allowed” error is reported. (Pacman uses the first *pkgname* if *pkgbase* is omitted.) Repeat pkgname if unsure. There is only one *pkgbase* section. The field values from this section are inherited unless overridden in the *pkgname* sections that follow it. An empty field value in the *pkgname* section cancels the inheritance.
*   pkgname: There may be multiple *pkgname* sections.

The following field names are associated with a single value for the section:

*   epoch
*   pkgver: package version, may be formatted as [*epoch*:]*pkgver* if the epoch field is not given separately
*   pkgrel: release number of the package specific to Arch Linux
*   pkgdesc
*   url

The following field names may be repeated on multiple lines in a section to add multiple values:

*   license: in case of multiple licenses separate them by a space
*   groups

The following field names may be repeated, and also may optionally have an architecture suffix, separated from the field name by an underscore:

*   depends: dependencies, one per line
*   makedepends
*   checkdepends
*   optdepends
*   conflicts
*   provides
*   replaces
*   source

Fields with other names are ignored. Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are also ignored. Lines may be indented. This format closely matches the `.PKGINFO` format that is used for binary packages in [pacman](/index.php/Pacman "Pacman")/libalpm.
