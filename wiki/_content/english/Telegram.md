[Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software) is a cloud-based instant messaging service. Telegram clients exist for both mobile (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Ubuntu Touch) and desktop systems (Windows, OS X, Linux). Users can send messages and exchange photos, videos, stickers and files of any type. Telegram also provides optional end-to-end-encrypted messaging, which has been criticized by security experts because of its custom nature.
