## Setup

### Required software

Install [LXC](/index.php/LXC "LXC") and the [lxd](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=lxd) package, then [start](/index.php/Start "Start") `lxd.service`.

See [Linux Containers#Enable support to run unprivileged containers (optional)](/index.php/Linux_Containers#Enable_support_to_run_unprivileged_containers_(optional) "Linux Containers") if you want to run *unprivileged* containers. Otherwise see [#Launching container without CONFIG_USER_NS](#Launching_container_without_CONFIG_USER_NS).

### Alternative installation method

An alternative method of installation is via [snapd](/index.php/Snapd "Snapd"), by installing the [snapd](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/snapd/) package and running:

```
# snap install lxd

```

### Configure LXD

LXD needs to configure a storage pool, and (if you want internet access) network configuration. To do so, run the following as root:

```
# lxd init

```

### Accessing LXD as a unprivileged user

By default the LXD daemon allows users in the `lxd` group access, so add your user to the group:

```
# usermod -a -G lxd <user>

```

**Warning:** Anyone added to the `lxd` group is root equivalent. More information [here](https://github.com/lxc/lxd#security) and [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxd/+bug/1829071).

## Usage

### Create container

LXD has two parts, the daemon (the lxd binary), and the client (the lxc binary). Now that the daemon is all configured and running, you can create a container:

```
$ lxc launch ubuntu:16.04

```

Alternatively, you can also use a remote LXD host as a source of images. One comes pre-configured in LXD, called "images" (images.linuxcontainers.org)

```
$ lxc launch images:centos/7/amd64 centos

```

To create an amd64 Arch container:

```
$ lxc launch images:archlinux/current/amd64 arch

```

### LXD Networking

LXD uses LXC's networking capabilities. By default it connects containers to the `lxcbr0` network device. Refer to the LXC documentation on [network configuration](/index.php/Linux_Containers#Host_network_configuration "Linux Containers") to set up a bridge for your containers.

If you want to use a different interface than `lxcbr0` edit the default using the lxc command line tool:

```
$ lxc profile edit default

```

An editor will open with a config file that by default contains:

```
name: default
config: {}
devices:
  eth0:
    name: eth0
    nictype: bridged
    parent: lxcbr0
    type: nic

```

You can set the `parent` parameter to whichever bridge you want LXD to attach the containers to by default.

## Troubleshooting

### Check kernel config

By default Arch Linux kernel is compiled correctly for Linux Containers and its frontend LXD. However, if you're using a custom kernel, or changed kernel options the kernel might be configured incorrectly. Verify that the running kernel is properly configured to run a container:

```
$ lxc-checkconfig

```

### Launching container without CONFIG_USER_NS

For launching images you must provide `security.privileged=true` during image creation:

```
$ lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 ubuntu -c security.privileged=true

```

Or for already existed image you may edit config:

 `$ lxc config edit ubuntu` 
```
name: ubuntu
profiles:
- default
config:
  ...
  security.privileged: "true"
  ...
devices:
  root:
    path: /
    type: disk
ephemeral: false

```

Or to enable `security.privileged=true` for new containers, edit the config for the default profile:

```
$ lxc profile edit default

```

### Resource limits are not applied when viewed from inside a container

The service lxcfs (found in the Community repository) needs to be installed and startedÂ :

```
$ systemctl start lxcfs

```

lxd will need to be restarted. Enable lxcfs for the service to be started at boot time.

### Starting a VM fails

Arch Linux does not distribute secure boot signed ovmf firmware, to boot VMs you need to disable secure boot for the time being.

```
$ lxc launch ubuntu:18.04 test-vm --vm -c security.secureboot=false

```

This can also be added to the default profile.

### No IPv4 with systemd-networkd

systemd version 244.1 detects if `/sys` is writeable by containers. If it is, udev is automatically started and breaks IPv4 in unprivileged containers. See [commit bf331d8](https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/commit/96d7083c5499b264ecebd6a30a92e0e8fda14cd5) and [discussion on linuxcontainers](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/no-ipv4-on-arch-linux-containers/6395).

To work around this two ways;

Add `raw.lxc: lxc.mount.auto = proc:rw sys:ro` in the profile to the container to ensure `/sys` is read-only.

Or, override `systemd.networkd.service`;

 `/etc/systemd/system/systemd-networkd.service.d/lxc.conf` 
```
[Service]
BindReadOnlyPaths=/sys
```

## Uninstall

[Stop](/index.php/Stop "Stop") and disable `lxd.service` and `lxd.socket`:

Then uninstall the package via pacman:

```
 # pacman -R lxd

```

If you uninstalled the package without disabling the service, you might have a lingering broken symlink at `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.wants/lxd.service`.

If you want to remove all data:

```
 # rm -r /var/lib/lxd

```

If you used any of the example networking configs, you should remove those as well.
