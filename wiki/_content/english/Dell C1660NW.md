Dell is a very popular, budget colour laser printer made by Dell. Unfortunately Dell has not released a proprietary driver for this printer, but reportedly it works fine with both of the following solutions:

*   [foo2zjs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/foo2zjs/) driver available in AUR.
*   [Xerox Phaser 6000B](/index.php/CUPS/Printer-specific_problems#Xerox_Phaser_6000B "CUPS/Printer-specific problems") driver.

Second option seems to be more straightforward.
