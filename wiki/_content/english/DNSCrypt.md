[DNSCrypt](http://dnscrypt.info/) encrypts and authenticates DNS traffic between user and DNS resolver. While IP traffic itself is unchanged, it prevents local spoofing of DNS queries, ensuring DNS responses are sent by the server of choice.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [dnscrypt-proxy](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dnscrypt-proxy) package.

## Configuration

### Startup

The service can be started in two mutually exclusive ways (i.e. only one of the two may be enabled):

*   With the `.service` file
*   Through the `.socket` activation aka unix socket activation (which then starts the service on access of said socket).

**Note:** For using the service directly, the `listen_addresses` option in `/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml` has to be configured (e.g. `listen_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:53', '[::1]:53']`). However, when using unix socket activation the option has to be the empty set (i.e. `listen_addresses = [ ]`), as systemd is taking care of the socket configuration.

### Select resolver

**Note:** By leaving `server_names` commented out in the configuration file `/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`, *dnscrypt-proxy* will choose the fastest server from the sources already configured under `[sources]` [[2]](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Configuration#an-example-static-server-entry). The lists will be downloaded, verified, and automatically updated. [[3]](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Configuration-Sources#what-is-the-point-of-these-lists). Thus, configuring a specific set of servers is optional.

Edit `/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml` and uncomment the `server_names` variable, selecting one or more of the servers. For example, to use Cloudflare's servers:

```
server_names = ['cloudflare', 'cloudflare-ipv6']

```

**Tip:**

*   You can find the full list of resolvers on the [upstream page](https://download.dnscrypt.info/resolvers-list/v2/public-resolvers.md), [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/master/v2/public-resolvers.md), or `/var/cache/dnscrypt-proxy/public-resolvers.md`.
*   Users should look at the description for servers on the public resolvers list and take note of which validate [DNSSEC](/index.php/DNSSEC "DNSSEC"), do not log, and are uncensored. These requirements can be configured globally with the `require_dnssec`, `require_nolog`, `require_nofilter` options.

### Disable any services bound to port 53

**Tip:** If using [#Unbound](#Unbound) as your local DNS cache this section can be ignored, as *unbound* runs on port 53 by default.

To see if any programs are using port 53, run

```
 $ ss -lp 'sport =Â :domain'

```

If the output contains more than the first line of column names, you need to disable whatever service is using port 53\. One common culprit is `systemd-resolved.service`, but other network managers may have analogous components. You are ready to proceed once the above command outputs nothing more than the following line:

```
 Netid               State                 Recv-Q                Send-Q                                 Local Address:Port                                   Peer Address:Port

```

### Modify resolv.conf

Modify the [resolv.conf](/index.php/Resolv.conf "Resolv.conf") file and replace the current set of resolver addresses with the address for *localhost* and options [[4]](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Installation-linux#step-4-change-the-system-dns-settings):

```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
options edns0 single-request-reopen

```

Other programs may overwrite this setting; see [resolv.conf#Preserve DNS settings](/index.php/Resolv.conf#Preserve_DNS_settings "Resolv.conf") for details.

### Start systemd service

Finally, [start/enable](/index.php/Start/enable "Start/enable") the `dnscrypt-proxy.service`.

## Tips and tricks

### Local DNS cache configuration

**Note:** *dnscrypt* can cache entries without relying on another program. This feature is enabled by default with the line `cache = true` in your dnscrypt configuration file

It is recommended to run DNSCrypt as a forwarder for a local DNS cache if not using *dnscrypt's* cache feature; otherwise, every single query will make a round-trip to the upstream resolver. Any local DNS caching program should work. In addition to setting up *dnscrypt-proxy*, you must setup your local DNS cache program.

#### Change port

In order to forward queries from a local DNS cache, *dnscrypt-proxy* should listen on a port different from the default `53`, since the DNS cache itself needs to listen on `53` and query *dnscrypt-proxy* on a different port. Port number `53000` is used as an example in this section. In this example, the port number is larger than 1024 so *dnscrypt-proxy* is not required to be run by root.

There are two methods for changing the default port:

**Socket method**

[Edit](/index.php/Edit "Edit") `dnscrypt-proxy.socket` with the following contents:

```
[Socket]
ListenStream=
ListenDatagram=
ListenStream=127.0.0.1:53000
ListenDatagram=127.0.0.1:53000

```

When queries are forwarded from the local DNS cache to `53000`, `dnscrypt-proxy.socket` will start `dnscrypt-proxy.service`.

**Service method**

Edit the `listen_addresses` option in `/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml` with the following:

```
listen_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:53000', '[::1]:53000']

```

#### Example local DNS cache configurations

The following configurations should work with *dnscrypt-proxy* and assume that it is listening on port `53000`.

##### Unbound

Configure [Unbound](/index.php/Unbound "Unbound") to your liking (in particular, see [Unbound#Local DNS server](/index.php/Unbound#Local_DNS_server "Unbound")) and add the following lines to the end of the `server` section in `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf`:

```
  do-not-query-localhost: no
forward-zone:
  name: "."
  forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@53000

```

**Tip:** If you are setting up a server, add `interface: 0.0.0.0@53` and `access-control: *your-network*/*subnet-mask* allow` inside the `server:` section so that the other computers can connect to the server. A client must be configured with `nameserver *address-of-your-server*` in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

[Restart](/index.php/Restart "Restart") `unbound.service` to apply the changes.

##### dnsmasq

Configure dnsmasq as a [local DNS cache](/index.php/Dnsmasq#DNS_cache_setup "Dnsmasq"). The basic configuration to work with DNSCrypt:

 `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` 
```
no-resolv
server=127.0.0.1#53000
listen-address=127.0.0.1
```

If you configured DNSCrypt to use a resolver with enabled DNSSEC validation, make sure to enable it also in dnsmasq:

 `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`  `proxy-dnssec` 

Restart `dnsmasq.service` to apply the changes.

##### pdnsd

Install [pdnsd](/index.php/Pdnsd "Pdnsd"). A basic configuration to work with DNSCrypt is:

 `/etc/pdnsd.conf` 
```
global {
    perm_cache = 1024;
    cache_dir = "/var/cache/pdnsd";
    run_as = "pdnsd";
    server_ip = 127.0.0.1;
    status_ctl = on;
    query_method = udp_tcp;
    min_ttl = 15m;       # Retain cached entries at least 15 minutes.
    max_ttl = 1w;        # One week.
    timeout = 10;        # Global timeout option (10 seconds).
    neg_domain_pol = on;
    udpbufsize = 1024;   # Upper limit on the size of UDP messages.
}

server {
    label = "dnscrypt-proxy";
    ip = 127.0.0.1;
    port = 53000;
    timeout = 4;
    proxy_only = on;
}

source {
    owner = localhost;
    file = "/etc/hosts";
}
```

Restart `pdnsd.service` to apply the changes.

### Sandboxing

[Edit](/index.php/Edit "Edit") `dnscrypt-proxy.service` to include the following lines:

```
[Service]
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_IPC_LOCK CAP_SETGID CAP_SETUID CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectKernelModules=true
ProtectControlGroups=true
PrivateTmp=true
PrivateDevices=true
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true
NoNewPrivileges=true
RestrictRealtime=true
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6
SystemCallArchitectures=native
SystemCallFilter=~@clock @cpu-emulation @debug @keyring @ipc @module @mount @obsolete @raw-io

```

See [systemd.exec(5)](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/systemd.exec.5) and [Systemd#Sandboxing application environments](/index.php/Systemd#Sandboxing_application_environments "Systemd") for more information. Additionally see [upstream comments](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/pull/601#issuecomment-284171727).

### Enable EDNS0

[Extension Mechanisms for DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_mechanisms_for_DNS "wikipedia:Extension mechanisms for DNS") that, among other things, allows a client to specify how large a reply over UDP can be.

Add the following line to your `/etc/resolv.conf`:

```
options edns0

```

You may also wish to append the following to `/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.conf`:

```
EDNSPayloadSize *<bytes>*

```

Where *<bytes>* is a number, the default size being **1252**, with values up to **4096** bytes being purportedly safe. A value below or equal to **512** bytes will disable this mechanism, unless a client sends a packet with an OPT section providing a payload size.

#### Test EDNS0

Make use of the [DNS Reply Size Test Server](https://www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/services/replysizetest), use the *drill* command line tool to issue a TXT query for the name *rs.dns-oarc.net*:

```
$ drill rs.dns-oarc.net TXT

```

With **EDNS0** supported, the "answer section" of the output should look similar to this:

```
rst.x3827.rs.dns-oarc.net.
rst.x4049.x3827.rs.dns-oarc.net.
rst.x4055.x4049.x3827.rs.dns-oarc.net.
"2a00:d880:3:1::a6c1:2e89 DNS reply size limit is at least 4055 bytes"
"2a00:d880:3:1::a6c1:2e89 sent EDNS buffer size 4096"

```

### Redundant DNSCrypt providers

To use several different dnscrypt providers, you may simply copy the original `dnscrypt-proxy.service` and `dnscrypt-proxy.socket`. Then in your new copy of the service change the command line parameters, either pointing to a new configuration file or naming a different resolver directly. From there change the port in the new copy of the socket. Lastly, update your local DNS cache program to point to new service's port. For example, with [unbound](/index.php/Unbound "Unbound") the configuration file would look like if using ports `53000` for the original socket and `53001` for the new socket.

 `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf` 
```
 do-not-query-localhost: no
 forward-zone:
   name: "."
   forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@53000
   forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@53001

```

#### Create instanced systemd service

An alternative option to copying the systemd service is to used an instanced service.

##### Create systemd file

First, create `/etc/systemd/system/dnscrypt-proxy@.service` containing:

```
[Unit]
Description=DNSCrypt client proxy
Documentation=man:dnscrypt-proxy(8)
Requires=dnscrypt-proxy@%i.socket

[Service]
Type=notify
NonBlocking=true
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dnscrypt-proxy \
    --resolver-name=%i
Restart=always

```

This specifies an instanced systemd service that starts a dnscrypt-proxy using the service name specified after the @ symbol of a corresponding .socket file.

##### Add dnscrypt-sockets

To create multiple dnscrypt-proxy sockets, copy `/usr/lib/systemd/system/dnscrypt-proxy.socket` to a new file, `/etc/systemd/system/dnscrypt-proxy@*short-name.here*.socket`, replacing the socket instance name with one of the short names listed in [`dnscrypt-resolvers.csv`](#Select_resolver) and [change the port](#Change_port). Use a different port for each instance (53000, 53001, and so forth).

##### Apply new systemd configuration

Now we need to reload the systemd configuration.

```
# systemctl daemon-reload

```

Since we are replacing the default service with a different name, we need to explicitly [stop](/index.php/Stop "Stop") and [disable](/index.php/Disable "Disable") `dnscrypt-proxy.service` and `dnscrypt-proxy.socket`.

Now [start/enable](/index.php/Start/enable "Start/enable") the new service(s), e.g., `dnscrypt-proxy@dnscrypt.eu-nl`, etc.

Finally [restart](/index.php/Restart "Restart") `unbound.service`.
