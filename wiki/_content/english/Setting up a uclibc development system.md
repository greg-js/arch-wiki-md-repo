(I converted this from html automatically, so it could do with cleaning up!)

If you want to build small static binaries, say for an _initrd_/_initramfs_, or maybe a boot floppy, one of the best ways of doing this is to use the _uclibc_ library instead of _glibc_. Here is how I got a development system set up, with which I could then compile _busybox_, _run-init_ (from _klibc_, for use in an _initramfs_), and the utilities from _unionfs_.

There are various ways of getting a system based on _uclibc_ running. The easiest is to use the development system offered on the _uclibc_ website ([www.uclibc.org](http://www.uclibc.org/)) in the form of a root file-system (prebuilt root file-system). It is not small - unpacked about 100M – but it provides all the basic tools for compiling with uclibc in ready-made form. An alternative, and more flexible approach is to use _buildroot_. I describe first how to get these set up, and then give some examples of their use.

    *   [3.3 Compiling run-init.c from klibc](#Compiling_run-init.c_from_klibc)

## Using a prebuilt root file-system

*   Download it to a new build directory, e.g. **~/BUILD/uclibc**. The file can be got from the _uclibc_ download server, it was named **root_fs_i386.ext2.bz2**.
*   Unzip it: 'bunzip2 root_fs_i386.ext2.bz2'
*   Make a mount point: 'mkdir mnt'
*   Make a folder for the development system: 'mkdir ucroot'
*   From now on you need to be root, so do a 'su', then

```
mount -o loop root_fs_i386.ext2 mnt
cp -a   mnt/* ucroot
rm -r ucroot/lost+found
umount mnt
rm root_fs_i386.ext2

```

*   To allow a normal user to read & write to **ucroot/home**: 'chmod 777 ucroot/home'
*   This gives you a tar-ball of your fresh system, in case you mess it up and want to start again, without the hassle above:

```
tar -cjf uclibc_rootfs.tar.bz2 -C ucroot .

```

Here I have just copied the development file-system to the directory **ucroot/**, so that it is available within the normal file-system. After copying and unmounting I can discard the original.

Unfortunately this pre-built _root_fs_ seems not to be updated any more, but at least it worked for me without any great difficulties.

## Using buildroot

The recommended method is to use _buildroot_ ([buildroot.uclibc.org](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/)), but at first I was too stupid for it, and it didn't work. After a bit of consideration, I decided to base my **.config** on that used to build the pre-built _root_fs_. The result was **buildroot_my_config** (see below), and this seemed to work. Well, if I remember correctly, it only worked after I had added a symlink from **/usr/bin/install** to **/bin/install**. The main change I made was to set the architecture to _i486_, and to select the tarred form for the final package (to save all the fiddling around with mounting). Of course, there are many other possible configurations.

I should warn you that the compilation takes a while (I think about 40 minutes on my P4 3GHz computer) and uses a lot of space (about 1.4GB were occupied at the end). Of course you can delete the build directory when the compilation is finished (but remember to take the result, in my case **rootfs.i486.tar**, out first – you might like to compress this 80MB lump for convenience).

When you unpack your tar-ball to your **ucroot/** directory, do it as root if you want to preserve permissions and the device nodes (though the latter won't be needed here).

## Using the development environment

To use the development environment, I can copy the needed source files into this directory tree, using e.g. the **ucroot/home/** directory (which is otherwise unused), and do something like 'chroot ucroot', as root of course, to get into it. It is quite convenient to have one terminal operating "chrooted" in this development environment and another in the normal environment running _mc_ (or some GUI file manager) for copying things around the system, etc., as nothing fancy is provided in the development environment.

### Compiling the unionfs utilities

These are best statically linked for use in an _initramfs_, and they will be much smaller if _uclibc_ is used.

*   Create directory **unionfs/** inside **home**
*   Create file **fistdev.mk**:

# Unionfs Makefile modifications
EXTRACFLAGS=-DUNIONFS_NDEBUG
PREFIX=/usr
UNIONFS_DEBUG_CFLAG=

# This builds static utils - but with glibc they get VERY big!
UNIONFS_OPT_CFLAG=-Os -static

# This stuff is necessary for compiling the kernel module
# when a kernel other than the running one is the target.
# It is not needed for the utilities.
LINUXSRC=/usr/src/linux
TOPINC=-I$(LINUXSRC)/include
MODDIR=/lib/modules/2.6.xx

*   Unpack the _unionfs_ tar-ball within **unionfs/**
*   Copy **fistdev.mk** into the base directory (e.g. **unionfs-1.1.2/**)
*   Run 'make utils' in that directory. In my case it failed building _unionimap_, but I guess you normally won't need that (whatever it is!)
*   Copy out **unionctl** and **uniondbg**, and strip them: 'strip unionctl uniondbg'

### Compiling busybox

I was playing around with LinuxLive scripts and the version supplied there seemed a bit large to me – maybe it was compiled against _glibc_? Anyway, I decided to do a _uclibc_ version. Unfortunately the 'make menuconfig' step didn't work for me in the _uclibc_ development environment. Maybe there's a trick or tweak (does anybody know?), but to get around this you can do 'make menuconfig' in your normal system and save the resulting **.config** file, delete the **busybox-x.x.x/** folder, unpack it again and copy your **.config** into that. Then do as below. If you don't start with a fresh folder in the_uclibc_ system, it won't work.

*   Enter the _chroot_ system
*   Unpack _busybox-1.0.1_ within the **home/** directory
*   Provide a **.config** as described above
*   _cd_ to the **busybox-1.0.1/** directory
*   make oldconfig
    make dep
    make
*   Copy out **busybox**

### Compiling run-init.c from klibc

*   Copy the file **run-init.c** from the _klibc_ package (I used 'klibc-1.1.1') to the **home/** directory
*   Enter the _chroot_ system
*   _cd_ to the directory containing **run-init.c**
*   'gcc -Os -static -o run-init run-init.c'
*   Copy out **run-init**
