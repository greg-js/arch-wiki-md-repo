[Gambas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambas "wikipedia:Gambas") is an object-oriented dialect of the BASIC programming language as well as the integrated development environment that accompanies it.

## Installation

**Note:** Gambas consists of a runtime and IDE further broken up into several distinct components. Not all of them may be needed for what you wish to do with the IDE or for running a specific Gambas application.

To install the latest stable version of Gambas 3, [install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [gambas3](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/gambas3/) package from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

## Tips and tricks

Gambas 3 can build installation packages for various distributions and has support for building Arch packages, perfect for use with the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

Gambas supports both the [GTK+](/index.php/GTK%2B "GTK+") and [Qt](/index.php/Qt "Qt") toolkits and can make use of both, allowing the application to fit seamlessly into most [Desktop environments](/index.php/Desktop_environment "Desktop environment"). This also applies to applications made inside the Gambas IDE, assuming the gb3-gui component is used.
