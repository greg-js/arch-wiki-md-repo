The Dell Latitude E6420.

This article will tell you how to get the basic components of the laptop running with Arch.

Very stable seems to work very well.

*   Brightness keys (Fn + up/down arrows)

## Installation

The [Installation guide](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide") should get you running. UEFI booting also works perfectly when enabled in the BIOS.

Seems to work out of the box

Install the [nvidia-340xx](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvidia-340xx/) package from pacman.
