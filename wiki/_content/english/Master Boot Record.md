The [Master Boot Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Boot_Record "w:Master Boot Record") (MBR) is the first 512 bytes of a storage device. It contains an operating system bootloader and the storage device's partition table. It plays an important role in the [boot process](/index.php/Boot_process "Boot process") under [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS "wikipedia:BIOS") systems.
