The [Acer Switch Alpha 12](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/switchalpha12) is a two 2 in 1 [Tablet PC](/index.php/Tablet_PC "Tablet PC") device, equipped with a 12 inch display that supports for 2160 x 1440 pixels. This installation was done on the version SA5-271-38U0 which is a version with an i3-6100 CPU and 4GB of RAM. Please note I was not using Arch-Linux directly, but used the derivate Antergos for the installation.

## Installation

You need to disable Secure Boot in BIOS first, which requires you to set a Supervisor Password. I also recommend to enable "F12 Boot Menue". To go into the BIOS, press "Volume Up" while powering up the device.

The remaining part of the installation should be the same as on every other x86 System.
