[Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org) is a distributed streaming platform that:

1.  Lets you publish and subscribe to streams of records. In this respect it is similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
2.  Lets you store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way.
3.  Lets you process streams of records as they occur.

## Installation
