[MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL "wikipedia:MySQL") is a widely spread, multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database, developed by Oracle.

Arch Linux favors [MariaDB](/index.php/MariaDB "MariaDB"), a community-developed fork of MySQL, aiming for drop-in compatibility. Oracle's MySQL was [dropped](https://www.archlinux.org/news/mariadb-replaces-mysql-in-repositories/) to the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR"): [mysql](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mysql/). Another fork aiming to be fully compatible is [Percona Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percona_Server_for_MySQL "wikipedia:Percona Server for MySQL"), available as [percona-server](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=percona-server).
