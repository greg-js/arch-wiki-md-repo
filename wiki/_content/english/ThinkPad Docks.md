Business laptops manufactured by Lenovo and IBM under the ThinkPad brand have a proprietary connector at the bottom of the laptop that is used in junction with docking stations that enable the ThinkPad to be used as a desktop PC.

These docking stations can function in two ways:

*   Passive port replicators (no active components)
*   Active docks (active components such as USB hubs or USB 3.0 controllers)

Both of them are supported under Linux, but some desktop environments like [Xfce](/index.php/Xfce "Xfce") or [LXDE](/index.php/LXDE "LXDE") don't handle these docks properly, which means when you dock the ThinkPad into the dock, usually the external screen stays blank and nothing happens. However, some desktops like [KDE](/index.php/KDE "KDE") and [GNOME](/index.php/GNOME "GNOME") handle these docks properly.

Also, when suspending outside the dock and waking in the dock display configurations usually do not auto-switch.

## Handling docks on desktops other than KDE and GNOME
