## Installing

There are several possible ways to install Arch onto a MSI Wind U100\. The most usual methods are booting from a USB stick/memory card, or from an external CD/DVD drive. Refer to [Category:Getting and installing Arch](/index.php/Category:Getting_and_installing_Arch "Category:Getting and installing Arch").

Regardless of choice, finish by hooking up the external device (CD drive or USB stick) to the notebook. Hold the F11 key while booting in order to get to the boot device menu, then proceed by selecting the appropriate device and install as normal.

## CPU

### cpufreq

you should use **acpi-cpufreq** driver which will allow you to slow down your CPU to 800MHz (p4-clockmod driver will work too, but it's not intended to be used with governors like ondemand, it should be used just for manual underclocking usig hotkeys or ACPI events like AC-disconnection because it's too slow to react fast enough to be suitable for use with automatic scaling based on CPU usage and therefore kernel will refuse to use such governors. however you can underclock cpu down to 200MHz using this driver). Probably you will also want to use **cpufreq-ondemand** governor.

### overclock

It is possible to overclock the MSI Wind using an upgraded BIOS. The overclock (turbo mode) can be activated with Fn+F10, however, this overclock is not reported in /proc/cpuinfo or by cpufreq-info.

## Multimedia

### Audio

Audio is supported through ALSA with virtually no configuration. Following the [ALSA](/index.php/ALSA "ALSA") article should cover all that is needed.

### Video

The on-board graphics uses the Intel driver. [Install](/index.php/Install "Install") [xf86-video-intel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-intel).

Aside from that, there are no out-of-the-ordinary configuration steps. Consult [Xorg](/index.php/Xorg "Xorg") and [Intel](/index.php/Intel "Intel") for more information.

### Webcam

First, do not forget to activate the webcam with the hotkey Fn+F6\. If it's still not working, then try loading the module. The webcam should be supported through the `uvcvideo` module by default, if not:

```
# modprobe uvcvideo

```

To load the webcam driver automatically, adding uvcvideo to the `MODULES` array in `/etc/[rc.conf](/index.php/Rc.conf "Rc.conf")` may be needed:

```
MODULES=(uvcvideo)

```

The webcam uses a resolution of 640x480\. As a warning, recording video with higher resolutions may result in a lower framerate.

## Networking

### Wireless

Determine which card the particular u100 version has by running `lspci`. These are the possibilities:

*   Realtek 8187se B/G
*   Ralink RT2860 B/G/N
*   Atheros AR928X B/G/N

The `lspci` output should mention the company name.

#### Realtek

Since kernel 2.6.29 there's a working driver included in the staging line. The module is `rtl8187se` and should get loaded without intervention. This network adapter is known to be buggy, so it's unlikely that this driver will show significant progress over its current state. Using [ndiswrapper](/index.php/Ndiswrapper "Ndiswrapper") in place of the in-kernel module is recommended because of this situation.

#### Ralink

The RT2860 now works out of the box with rt2x00pci drivers.

#### Atheros

AR5001 (rev 02) works out of the box with ath5k or mad wifi drivers.

### BlueTooth

Some versions of MSI Wind do have internal USB bluetooth module. It should be autodetected (using modules btusb, bluetooth and rfkill). However there is bug (probably in kernel) that prevent's people from toggling bluetooth using fn+f11 if it wasn't active during boot. (toggling wifi using fn+f11 remains working) If you happen to reboot your linux with BT deactivated, you will probably need to use windows or some distribution without this bug (BackTrack 4 was reported to work) to activate it again. There is hope this will be fixed in future. (please let us know if you will find any solution for this issue)

### Touchpad

#### Sentelic

The Sentelic Finger Sensing Pad driver (version 1.0.0) is included in kernel 2.26.32 and above, however, it may be difficult to get the configuration utility (fspc) to work correctly. It is possible to configure the pad manually by adding the following lines to your /etc/rc.local

```
# Disable tap-to-click:
echo -n c>>/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/flags

# Disable vertical tap scrolling:
echo -e \0>>/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/vscroll

# Disable horizontal tap scrolling:
echo -e \0>>/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/hscroll

```

#### Synaptics

Some models of the U100 have a Synaptics touchpad installed. The Synaptics driver can be installed as described [here](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics "Touchpad Synaptics"). Vertical and horizontal edge scrolling work, and can be enabled in the synaptics .conf file:

 `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf` 
```
 Section "InputClass"
       Identifier "touchpad"
       Driver "synaptics"
       MatchIsTouchpad "on"
              Option "TapButton1" "1"
              Option "TapButton2" "2"
              Option "TapButton3" "3"
              Option "VertEdgeScroll" "on"
              Option "HorizEdgeScroll" "on"
              ...
 EndSection

```

### LAN

The Ethernet adapter functions thanks to the `r8169` module present in kernels 2.26.31 and newer.

## Memory stick reader

The multi-card reader appears to work automatically.

In some cases udev might be failing to update block device tree even after the memory card has been removed. The solution is to manually force udev to update:

```
# udevadm trigger

```

## Power management

pm-utils usually works without issues. However, some users have reported that it may require adding the [resume hook](/index.php/Pm-utils#Resume_Hook "Pm-utils") and removing the [autodetect hook](/index.php/Pm-utils#Blank_screen_issue "Pm-utils") before working correctly.
