There are a lot of netbooks under the Aspire One banner. Here's a third-party website that lists them (at least up through 2009): [Aspire One Cheatsheet](http://netbookscoop.com/buyers-guide/aspire-one-cheatsheets/)

*   Had to drop to other console, wipe partition table with fdisk before cfdisk would work

### Fn Keycodes

The Aspire One US keyboard when operating under WinXP has a number of special keys which are accessed by holding down the Function/Fn key and the relevant key. Some of these operate under Arch as well, but most do not.

<caption>**Fn+ Data**</caption>
| Fn+ | Action in WinXP | Console Keycode/Effect | X Keycode/Effect |
| Left Arrow | LCD Brighten | 112; works OOB but also types "?" character | No symbol; works OOB |
| Down Arrow | Volume Down | 114 | XF86AudioLowerVolume |
| Right Arrow | LCD Dim | 118; works OOB but also types "?" character | plusminus; works OOB but also types +/- symbol |
| Pg Up | Home | 102 | Home |
| Up Arrow | Volume Up | 115 | XF86AudioRaiseVolume |
| Pg Dn | End | 107 | End |
| m | Keypad 0 | 82; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_Insert; works with NumLk on |
| . | Keypad . | 83; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_Delete; works with NumLk on |
| / | Keypad + | 78; works with NumLk on | works |
| j | Keypad 1 | 79; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_End; works with NumLk on |
| k | Keypad 2 | 80; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_Down; works with NumLk on |
| l | Keypad 3 | 81; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_Next; works with NumLk on |
| Â ; | Keypad - | 74; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_; works with NumLk on |
| u | Keypad 4 | 75; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_Left; works with NumLk on |
| l | Keypad 5 | 76; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_Begin; works with NumLk on |
| o | Keypad 6 | 77; works with NumLk on | with Fn gives KP_Right; works with NumLk on |
| p | Keypad * | 55; works with NumLk on | works |
| 7 | Keypad 7 | 71; |
| 8 | Keypad 8 | 72; |
| 9 | Keypad 9 | 73; |
| 0 | Keypad / | 98; |
| F1 | Launch Fn key help | None |
| F2 | Launch System Properties | None |
| F3 | Launch Power Options | None |
| F4 | Sleep Mode | None |
| F5 | Toggle to external display | 225 |
| F6 | Turn off LCD backlight | Works OOB |
| F7 | Turn touchpad off/on | Works OOB |
| F8 | Mute/unmute | None |
| F11 | NumLk | None; works (including LED) |
| F12 | Scr Lk | None |

As you can see, some of the stuff "Just Works" and some of the stuff (Fn+F1, F2, F3) will never work, since it doesn't produce a keycode of any sort. I used Compiz keybindings deal with the things in the middle and to compensate for the things that won't ever work.
