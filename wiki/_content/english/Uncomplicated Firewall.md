## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [ufw](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=ufw) package.

Start ufw as [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd") [service](/index.php/Daemon "Daemon") to have it running and enable it to make it available after boot.

## Basic configuration

A very simplistic configuration which will deny all by default, allow any protocol from inside a 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.255 LAN, and allow incoming Deluge and SSH traffic from anywhere:

```
# ufw default deny
# ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24
# ufw allow Deluge
# ufw allow SSH

```

The next line is only needed *once* the first time you install the package:

```
# ufw enable

```

Then enable the `ufw` service with [systemctl](/index.php/Systemd#Using_units "Systemd").

Finally, query the rules being applied via the status command:

 `# ufw status` 
```
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
Anywhere                   ALLOW       192.168.0.0/24
Deluge                     ALLOW       Anywhere
SSH                        ALLOW       Anywhere

```

The status report shows the rules added by the user. For most cases this will be what is needed, but it is good to be aware that builtin-rules do exist. These include filters to allow UPNP, AVAHI and DHCP replies. In order to see all rules setup

```
# ufw show raw 

```

may be used, as well as further reports listed in the manpage. Since these reports also summarize traffic, they may be somewhat difficult to read. Another way to check for accepted traffic:

```
# iptables -S | grep ACCEPT

```

While this works just fine for reporting, keep in mind not to enable the `iptables` service as long as you use `ufw` for managing it.

**Note:** If special network variables are set on the system in `/etc/sysctl.d/*`, it may be necessary to update `/etc/ufw/sysctl.conf` accordingly since this configuration overrides the default settings.

## Adding other applications

The PKG comes with some defaults based on the default ports of many common daemons and programs. Inspect the options by looking in the `/etc/ufw/applications.d` directory or by listing them in the program itself:

```
# ufw app list

```

If users are running any of the applications on a non-standard port, it is recommended to simply make `/etc/ufw/applications.d/custom` containing the needed data using the defaults as a guide.

**Warning:** If users modify any of the PKG provided rule sets, these will be overwritten the first time the ufw package is updated. This is why custom app definitions need to reside in a non-PKG file as recommended above!

Example, deluge with custom tcp ports that range from 20202-20205:

```
[Deluge-my]
title=Deluge
description=Deluge BitTorrent client
ports=20202:20205/tcp
```

Should you require to define both tcp and udp ports for the same application, simply separate them with a pipe as shown: this app opens tcp ports 10000-10002 and udp port 10003:

```
ports=10000:10002/tcp|10003/udp

```

One can also use a comma to define ports if a range is not desired. This example opens tcp ports 10000-10002 (inclusive) and udp ports 10003 and 10009

```
ports=10000:10002/tcp|10003,10009/udp

```

## Deleting applications

Drawing on the Deluge/Deluge-my example above, the following will remove the standard Deluge rules and replace them with the Deluge-my rules from the above example:

```
# ufw delete allow Deluge
# ufw allow Deluge-my

```

Query the result via the status command:

 `# ufw status` 
```
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
Anywhere                   ALLOW       192.168.0.0/24
SSH                        ALLOW       Anywhere
Deluge-my                  ALLOW       Anywhere

```

## Black listing IP addresses

It might be desirable to add ip addresses to a blacklist which is easily achieved simply by editing `/etc/ufw/before.rules` and inserting an iptables DROP line at the bottom of the file right above the "COMMIT" word.

 `/etc/ufw/before.rules` 
```
...
## blacklist section
# block just 199.115.117.99
-A ufw-before-input -s 199.115.117.99 -j DROP
# block 184.105.*.*
-A ufw-before-input -s 184.105.0.0/16 -j DROP

# don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these rules won't be processed
COMMIT

```

## Rate limiting with ufw

ufw has the ability to deny connections from an IP address that has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last 30 seconds. Users should consider using this option for services such as sshd.

Using the above basic configuration, to enable rate limiting we would simply replace the allow parameter with the limit parameter. The new rule will then replace the previous.

 `# ufw limit SSH` 
```
Rule updated

```
 `# ufw status` 
```
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
Anywhere                   ALLOW       192.168.0.0/24
SSH                        LIMIT       Anywhere
Deluge-my                  ALLOW       Anywhere

```

## User rules

All user rules are stored in `etc/ufw/user.rules` and `etc/ufw/user6.rules` for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.

## Tips and tricks

### Disable remote ping

Change `ACCEPT` to `DROP` in the following lines:

 `/etc/ufw/before.rules` 
```
# ok icmp codes
-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -j ACCEPT
-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type source-quench -j ACCEPT
-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded -j ACCEPT
-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type parameter-problem -j ACCEPT
-A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT

```

If you use IPv6, related rules are in `/etc/ufw/before6.rules`.

### Disable UFW logging

Disabling logging may be useful to stop UFW filling up the kernel (`dmesg`) and message logs:

```
# ufw logging off

```

## GUI frontends

### Gufw

[gufw](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gufw) is a GTK front-end for Ufw that aims to make managing a Linux firewall as accessible and easy as possible. It features pre-sets for common ports and p2p applications. It requires [python](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python), [ufw](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=ufw), and GTK support.

### kcm-ufw

[kcm-ufw](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kcm-ufw/) is KDE4 control module for ufw. The following features are supported:

*   Enable/disable firewall
*   Configure firewall default settings
*   Add, edit, and remove rules
*   Re-order rules via drag'n'drop
*   Import/export of rules
*   Setting of some IP tables modules

The module will appear under "Network and Connectivity" category.
