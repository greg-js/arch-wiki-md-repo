### Fingerprint Reader

The fingerprint reader included with this model `138a:0097 Validity Sensors, Inc` currently lacks a linux driver. [libfprint bugreport](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94536). Synaptics (which has acquired 'Validity Sensors') has unofficially said that they cannot disclose the protocol, but may possibly release a binary driver.

Open source Linux driver is being developed by reverse engineering the Windows driver. [[1]](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90)

## Configuration

### Keyboard Fn Shortcuts

*   Fn+4 sends XF86Sleep (puts computer to sleep by default)
*   Fn+S sends Alt_L+Sys_Req
*   Fn+P sends Pause
*   Fn+B sends Control_L+Break
*   Fn+K sends Scroll_Lock
*   Fn by itself sends XF86WakeUp (wakes computer from sleep by default)

### Display

There are two options for displays:

*   14" FHD IPS (1920 x 1080): Works
*   14" WQHD (2560 x 1440):Â ??

### TrackPoint Scrolling

TrackPoint Scrolling is working out of the box in GNOME and MATE. In some WindowManagers, the TrackPoint middle-button scrolling can be enabled by [installing](/index.php/Installing "Installing") the [xorg-xinput](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xorg-xinput) package from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories") and appending the following line to your [.xinitrc](/index.php/.xinitrc ".xinitrc"):

 `xinput set-prop "ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse" "libinput Scroll Method Enabled" 0 0 1` 

### Lenovo ThinkPad USB-C Dock

The USB-C Dock is a Thunderbolt 3 device. Plugging it in results in a whole lot of PCI entries:

```
06:00.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge (C step) [Alpine Ridge 4C 2016] (rev 02)
07:00.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge (C step) [Alpine Ridge 4C 2016] (rev 02)
07:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge (C step) [Alpine Ridge 4C 2016] (rev 02)
07:02.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge (C step) [Alpine Ridge 4C 2016] (rev 02)
07:04.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 Bridge (C step) [Alpine Ridge 4C 2016] (rev 02)
3c:00.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Device 15d4 (rev 02)

```

It works nearly perfect out of the box with Kernel 4.10.13\. The only thing that did not work is the r8152 based USB Ethernet Port, which gives the message:

```
[    7.574773] r8152 4-1.1:1.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): Unknown version 0x6010

```

Installing [r8152-dkms](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/r8152-dkms/) fixes this (the DKMS module adds the version 0x6010 to the module).

Even hot plugging works: unplugging the dock while a display is connected just lets all the devices disappear. Replugging it later works, all the USB devices come back up automagically, thought you might need to issue a xrandr to get the display showing again (tested with Xorg based i3 setup).

### Thunderbolt 3 Dock

The HP Thunderbolt 3 Dock is working out of the box.
