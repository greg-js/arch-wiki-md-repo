## [Calibrating Touch Screen](/index.php/Calibrating_Touchscreen#Your_screen "Calibrating Touchscreen")

Unfortunately there is no solution found for [Wayland](/index.php/Wayland "Wayland")Â :( (so if you are using GNOME with gdm, disable Wayland in "/etc/gdm/custom.conf" which is enabled by dafault and login with the option "Gnome on Xorg". )

Then create "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf"

 `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf` 
```
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier	"calibration"
	MatchProduct	"silead_ts"
	Option	"CalibrationMatrix"	"2.074595 0 0 0 2.688341 0 0 0 1"
	Driver	"libinput"
EndSection

```

Reboot and touchscreen will work fine. If not, make sure you have [mssl1680-firmware](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mssl1680-firmware/) installed.
