## Installation

Install [ccid](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=ccid) and [opensc](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=opensc) from [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories").

### Configuration

**Note:** You should not have to edit your opensc configuration files by default. You should check all other setup items first (e.g. certificate imports)

If your card reader does not have a pin pad, uncomment `enable_pinpad = false` in `/etc/opensc.conf`.

Sometimes [opensc](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=opensc) can struggle to identify the proper driver for CAC, instead it may choose PIV or something else. You can force the CAC driver by editing `/etc/opensc.conf` for `card_drivers = cac` and `force_card_driver = cac`

## Enable pcscd

[Start](/index.php/Start "Start") and enable `pcscd.socket`.

## Configure browser

1\. Go to: [http://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/Pages/tools.aspx](http://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/Pages/tools.aspx)

2\. Download certs: *"Trust Store" -> "PKI CA Certificate Bundles: PKCS#7" -> "For DoD PKI Only - Version 5.3"* (ZIP Download)

3\. Unzip the DoD PKI zip

4\. Follow browser-specific instructions

### Firefox

#### Load security device

Navigate to *Edit -> Preference -> Advanced -> Certificates -> Security Devices* and click "Load" to load a module using `/usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so` or `/usr/lib/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so`.

**Note:** Firefox may report the module did not load correctly however you will have to check in the security devices to confirm whether the module properly loaded or not

#### Import the DoD Certificates

Install the certificates from the mentioned zip-file in *this* order, by going to *Edit -> Preference -> Advanced -> Certificates -> View Certificates -> Authorities -> Import* (make sure to at-least check the box for "Trust this CA to identify websites"):

**Note:** As of the 5.3 version of the certificate zip

1\. Certificates_PKCS7_v5.3_DoD.der.p7b

2\. Certificates_PKCS7_v5.3_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_2.der.p7b

3\. Certificates_PKCS7_v5.3_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_3.der.p7b

4\. Certificates_PKCS7_v5.3_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_4.der.p7b

5\. Certificates_PKCS7_v5.3_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_5.der.p7b

6\. Certificates_PKCS7_v5.3_DoD.pem.p7b

### Chromium/Google Chrome

1\. Add the CAC Module to the NSS DB.

Ensure that your CAC is connected, that [Chromium](/index.php/Chromium "Chromium") is closed and enter the following in a terminal: `$ modutil -dbdir sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb/ -add "CAC Module" -libfile /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so`

**Note:** You may see the message 'Failure to load dynamic library'. This can be ignored.

Upon success you will see "Module "CAC Module" added to database."

2\. Check if the CAC Module was successfully added with `$ modutil -dbdir sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb/ -list`

3\. Navigate (in a shell) to the location of the unzip DoD PKI files and install via:

```
 for n in $(ls * | grep Chrome); do certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t TC -n $n -i $n; done

```

or

Re-open Chrome, Navigate to *Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> Manage Certificates -> Authorities* to load CA bundle from the PEM-formatted file from above.

4\. Verify the authority is in Chrome under *Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> Manage Certificates -> Authorities* then expand "org-U.S. Government" and you should see a number of "DoD" certificates listed.

## Testing

Visit your favorite CAC secured web page and you should be asked for the *Master Password* for your certificate. Enter it and if you get in, you know it's working.

If some sites/pages seem to have a problem working correctly (e.g. outlook web access won't authenticate the session for DoD webmail) try using a private/incognito session to test validity of the cert chain and remove some variables.

## Debugging

### opensc-tool

Most of this information was found in a [blog post by Firas Kra√Øem](http://blog.fkraiem.org/2013/03/13/linux-smart-card-authentication-howto/)

Verify opensc can see your reader

 `$ opensc-tool --list-readers ` 
```
