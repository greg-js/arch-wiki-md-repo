All files in the /lib directory have been moved to /usr/lib and now /lib is a symlink to usr/lib.

During this update, pacman will identify a conflict in the /lib directory with the message:

```
error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
glibc: /lib exists in filesystem
Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.

```

**Warning:** **DO NOT USE --force!** This will seriously break your system. If you are coming to this guide too late and you have already used --force... there are ways to fix your system. [These](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1126667#p1126667) [two](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1127251#p1127251) do not even require a rescue disk.

**Note:** for installs that have not been updated to glibc-2.16, it will save you lots of time and prevent major breakage to do:

```
pacman -U http://pkgbuild.com/~allan/glibc-2.16.0-1-<arch>.pkg.tar.xz

```

where <arch> is replaced by i686 or x86_64 as required. Add a single "-d" if needed. The instructions below assume that this has been done.

In the simplest case, the update can be performed by doing:

```
pacman -Syu --ignore glibc
pacman -Su

```

To be safe, also regenerate your initramfs after finishing:

```
mkinitcpio -p linux

```

There are two possible issues that might occur during this update.

## Issue 1: glibc dependency errors

If running "pacman -Syu --ignore glibc,curl" gives:

```
warning: ignoring package glibc-2.16.0-2
warning: cannot resolve "glibc>=2.16", a dependency of "gcc-libs"

...

:: The following packages cannot be upgraded due to unresolvable dependencies:
     binutils  gcc  gcc-libs

Do you want to skip the above packages for this upgrade [y/N]

```

Say "y" to skipping the packages, then install them all using (e.g.):

```
pacman -Sd binutils gcc gcc-libs

```

**Warning:** If pacman is part of this list, install the glibc-2.16.0-1 package from the above note first, to prevent breakage.

Note the use of a single "-d" only ignores the versioning of dependencies and not the actual dependency itself. Then finish the update using:

```
pacman -Su

```

## Issue 2: The final "pacman -Su" still has conflicts in /lib

### Packages that own files in /lib

If after this the "pacman -Su" still has conflicts with /lib, this is likely because a package on your system **other than glibc** owns files in /lib. Such packages can be detected using:

```
$ grep '^lib/' /var/lib/pacman/local/*/files

```

These packages need rebuilding so as not to include the /lib directory. They can also simply be uninstalled and reinstalled again after upgrading glibc. The the final "pacman -Su" will successfully install glibc if there are no untracked files (see the next section).

### Unpackaged files

This means that you have files or folders still in /lib or pacman thinks a package apart from glibc still own /lib. You can see which package own files in /lib by using:

```
$ find /lib -exec pacman -Qo -- {} +

```

If any package apart from glibc is listed as owning a file, that package needs to be updated to install its files in /usr/lib. Any files unowned by a package should either be deleted or moved to /usr/lib and any directories within /lib need deleted (after they are empty...).

One common source of files in /lib is left overs from running depmod after upgrading the kernel, but prior to reboot. The kernel modules included with the [linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux) package in the repositories are now stored in `/usr/lib/modules`.

## Success

You can confirm the update is complete by looking in your root directory to see that lib is a symlink to usr/lib.

 `$ ls -ld /lib`  `lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root     7 Jul 11 21:10 lib -> usr/lib`
