This page contains instructions, tips, pointers, and links for installing and configuring Arch Linux on the ASUS Zenbook UX51Vz ultrabook.

See the page for its 13" variant [ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A](/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Prime_UX31A "ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A") that has mostly orthogonal information to those here (may be only partially applicable to UX51Vz)

## Installation

The UX51Vz comes in a variety of configurations, most of those sold in western Europe come with two SSDs (2x128GB or 2x256GB) in an Intel Rapid Storage (aka Intel Matrix) RAID 0 configuration. To install Arch Linux on the UX51Vz, you can follow the official [Installation guide](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide"). Since the UX51Vz uses UEFI and GPT, make sure to also read the [UEFI](/index.php/UEFI "UEFI"), [GPT](/index.php/GPT "GPT") and [Arch boot process#Boot loader](/index.php/Arch_boot_process#Boot_loader "Arch boot process") pages. It is recommended to use rEFInd as a bootloader and mount the EFI partition on /boot. To prepare a UEFI USB device, read [UEFI#Create UEFI bootable USB from ISO](/index.php/UEFI#Create_UEFI_bootable_USB_from_ISO "UEFI"). The only way to preserve the pre-installed Windows instance is to install Arch with RAID without breaking up the RAID 0 array. See [RAID](/index.php/RAID "RAID") with the only difference that you should not create arrays, only assemble.

**Note:** As of BIOS version 207 on UX51VZH there is no option to reconfigure the Intel RST setup through BIOS. Once you break your array, you cannot set it up again. For Linux-only users, mdadm software raid should be a better option.

To report the RAID information from the Option ROM (for instance "Intel(R) Matrix Storage Manager"):

```
mdadm --detail-platform

```

To get general details:

```
mdadm -D /dev/md127

```

To examine information (including members):

```
mdadm -E /dev/md127

```

This is the important part that uses imsm (Intel Matrix) metadata! To assemble the RAID array inside the container, and/or to start it (the -e option declares the style of RAID metadata (superblock) to be used):

```
mdadm -I -e imsm /dev/md127

```

To check the current state:

```
cat /proc/mdstat

```

To add it to the configuration file (to be activated automagically at boot):

```
mdadm --examine --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf

```

Then proceed with partitioning and file systems creation as usual.

### Boot from USB medium

Press `Escape` to get into the boot menu. If the USB bootable device is not listed, enter the configuration menu and directly press `F10` to save. Press `Escape` again on reboot: This time the USB bootable device should appear in the menu.

Select 'Boot Arch Linux (x86_64)" and press `Enter`. The installation system will be booted and you will end up with a terminal.

## Function keys

The function keys are largely the same as described in [ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A](/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Prime_UX31A "ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A"). This goes for both screen backlight (which actually works out of the box on KDE as of June 2013) and keyboard backlight.

## Solid State Drive

Check [Solid State Drives](/index.php/Solid_State_Drives "Solid State Drives")

## Touchpad

See [ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A](/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_Prime_UX31A "ASUS Zenbook Prime UX31A"), the touchpad is the same.

## Powersave management

For automatic powersaving when on battery configure [Laptop Mode Tools](/index.php/Laptop_Mode_Tools "Laptop Mode Tools"). For manual power saving see [Power saving](/index.php/Power_saving "Power saving"). Also check out [Powertop](/index.php/Powertop "Powertop").

The UX51Vz can run a little hot, this is especially true for the HiDPI variant (aka UX51VZH) because the discrete GPU is always on. Be sure to check out [Linux Thermal Daemon](https://01.org/linux-thermal-daemon) (available as [thermald](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=thermald) in the AUR), which proactively controls thermal using P-states, T-states, and the Intel power clamp driver. It can do wonders for temperature management while avoiding to spin up the fans.

## Hardware and Modules

#### PCI

This is output of lspci -nnn -k on the UX51Vz-DB114H. Note that unlike most other UX51Vz models, this one has no integrated Intel graphics (plain Nvidia, not Optimus) and a retina 2880x1620 display.
