[Viber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viber "wikipedia:Viber") is a proprietary, cross-platform instant messaging and videotelephony service. Account creation requires a phone number, and enabling Viber on Arch or any other desktop platform requires pairing it with the respective mobile device (Android, iOS) that has the application installed on it.

## Installation

To install the official Viber client, get [viber](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/viber/), built by nslxndr. Newer versions may be available directly from the Viber website ([https://www.viber.com/download/](https://www.viber.com/download/)), although they are DEB and RPM packages.

There are no known third-party clients.
