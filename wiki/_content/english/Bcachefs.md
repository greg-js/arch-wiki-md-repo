[Bcachefs](https://bcachefs.org/) is a next-generation CoW filesystem that aims to provide features from [Btrfs](/index.php/Btrfs "Btrfs") and [ZFS](/index.php/ZFS "ZFS") with a cleaner codebase, more stability, greater speed and a GPL-compatible license.

It is built upon [Bcache](/index.php/Bcache "Bcache") and is mainly developed by Kent Overstreet.

## Installation

Bcachefs is not in the upstream [Kernel](/index.php/Kernel "Kernel") yet but the [linux-bcachefs-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-bcachefs-git/) kernel can be installed from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

The Bcachefs userspace tools are available from [bcachefs-tools-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bcachefs-tools-git/).
