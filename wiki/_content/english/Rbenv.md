[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) (Simple Ruby Version Management) lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Ruby. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

Another tool to be used for the same purpose is [RVM](/index.php/RVM "RVM").

## Installation

You can install [rbenv](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rbenv/) from the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR").

## Plugins

rbenv can be extended via a plugin system, and the rbenv wiki includes a [list of useful plugins](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Plugins). The ruby-build plugin is especially useful, as it allows you to install Ruby versions with the `rbenv install` command. You can install [ruby-build](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ruby-build/) from the AUR.
