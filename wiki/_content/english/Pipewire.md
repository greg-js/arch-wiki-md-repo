From [pipewire.org](http://pipewire.org):

	PipeWire is a project that aims to greatly improve handling of audio and video under Linux. It aims to support the usecases currently handled by both [PulseAudio](/index.php/PulseAudio "PulseAudio") and [Jack](/index.php/Jack "Jack") and at the same time provide same level of powerful handling of Video input and output. It also introduces a security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy, with supporting [Flatpak](/index.php/Flatpak "Flatpak") applications being the primary goal. Alongside [Wayland](/index.php/Wayland "Wayland") and [Flatpak](/index.php/Flatpak "Flatpak") we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block for the future of Linux application development. Features include:

*   Capture and playback of audio and video with minimal latency.
*   Real-time Multimedia processing on audio and video.
*   Multiprocess architecture to let applications share multimedia content.
*   GStreamer plugins for easy use and integration in current applications.
*   Sandboxed applications support. See Flatpak for more info.
