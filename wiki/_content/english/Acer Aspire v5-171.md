## Networking

*   wifi and ethernet work perfectly.

## Xorg

The touchpad works out of the box. However, you may want to uncomment the line Option "AreaBottomEdge", in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf.

You may also want to lock the touchpad while typing. Run

```
   syndaemon -k -i 2 -d

```

## Special keys

*   Volume keys work once volumeicon is installed.
*   Brightness: In /etc/default/grub, add "acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor" in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.
*   wifi: ok
*   touchpad lock: ok
*   turn on/off screen: ok.
