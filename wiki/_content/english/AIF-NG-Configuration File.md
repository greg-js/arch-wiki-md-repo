The AIF-NG configuration file is in [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "wikipedia:XML"). While not perhaps the most "human-readable" format, it is well-structured (unlike JSON), can be parsed by python 3 with no additional modules (unlike YAML), supports nesting (unlike INI), supports commenting (unlike JSON/simple YAML), and supports data validation (unlike both JSON and YAML).

## By Hand

For detailed explanation of each component, see [the upstream documentation](https://aif.square-r00t.net/#writing_an_xml_configuration_file). However, here's a quick example with comments (so you can deploy this example live and it will still validate) explaining what each component does/is for.

The comments are enclosed as such:

## Generating via aif-config

The [aif](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aif/) and [aif-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aif-git/) packages provide **/usr/bin/aif-config**, which can be used to generate a configuration file, convert a configuration file from JSON, or validate an existing configuration file.

To create a new configuration file, simply run:

```
aif-config create

```

It will run you through an interactive prompt. If you encounter a question you're not sure how to answer, reply with **wikihelp** and it will display some links to relevant documentation.

By default it will create a file called ./aif.xml but you can change where to save it by invoking as:

```
aif-config create -f path/to/where/to/save/it.xml

```

## Validating

It is a **very** good idea to validate your configuration file before deploying. The aif-config tool will do this by default when creating a configuration file if you have the [python-lxml](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=python-lxml) package installed.

It of course can't logically do every sort of validation, but it will make sure your XML is valid and matches the appropriate schema/spec (/usr/share/doc/aif/aif.xsd). This should rule out most common errors.
