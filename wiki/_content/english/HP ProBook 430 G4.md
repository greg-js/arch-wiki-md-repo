## Device information

This is a work in progress with information about the HP ProBook 430 G4\. There are many configurations for these models of HP Probooks. Mine is a HP ProBook 430 G4/822C, BIOS P85 Ver. 01.03 12/05/2016, shipped with a Core i5-7200U, 8GB, 256GB SSD. I've added a 2nd 8GB memory rig and placed my old 64GB 2,5" SATA SSD into the 2nd slot. The UEFI bios allows legacy boot.

Basic information for the new [HP ProBook 430 G4](http://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-updates-the-mainstream-ProBook-400-series.174476.0.html) model. Hardware works out of the box. No configuration was needed. Information for the "Not tested" units will be posted additionally.

## Backlight

I have not found a solution so far to control the backlight via kernel hardware control keys via kernel. So backlight control works only via software. It works out of the box under Xfce and under i3wm I use a custom command using " xbacklight -inc/-dec 10".

## ACPI errors

There are lots of acpi related error messages with kernel 4.9.x:

## Touchpad

Middle click doesn't work so far.

## Graphic card setup

Either modesetting driver or Intel driver seem to work well. I'm using the Intel driver here. DRI3 seems to work well.

 `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` 
```
