Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities.

Ejabberd has been in development since 2002 and is used all over the world to power the largest XMPP deployments. This project is so versatile that you can deploy it and customize it for very large scale, no matter what is your use case.
