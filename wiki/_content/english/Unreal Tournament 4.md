### Installing from the AUR

Unreal Tournament 4 can be compiled from source by using the [unreal-tournament-4](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/unreal-tournament-4/) package in [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR") or you can download a compiled version from their forum and install it with the [ut4](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ut4/) package.

The package needs about 100 GiB free space to build, with 10 GiB of source files to download, and the compilation might take a few hours.
