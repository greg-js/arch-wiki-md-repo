**Visual Studio Code** (**VSCode**) is a cross-platform, free and open-source (licensed under the MIT License) text editor developed by Microsoft and written in JavaScript and TypeScript. It is built on the Electron framework and is extensible using extensions, which can be browsed from within the text editor itself (via its extension gallery) or from [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode). While open-source, a proprietary build (licensed under an End-User License Agreement) provided by Microsoft is available and used as the basis for the [visual-studio-code](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code/) AUR package.
