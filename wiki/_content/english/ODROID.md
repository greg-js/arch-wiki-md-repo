There are several supported ODROID ARM boards available to consumers. This wiki page offers general configuration that should be applicable to them all. At this point, the content has been verified to work on the ODROID-C2 and ODROID-U3.

**Note:** Support for the ARM architecture is provided on [http://archlinuxarm.org](http://archlinuxarm.org) not through posts to the official Arch Linux Forum. Any posts related to ARM specific issues will be promptly closed per the [Code of conduct#Arch Linux distribution support *only*](/index.php/Code_of_conduct#Arch_Linux_distribution_support_.2Aonly.2A "Code of conduct") policy.

## Kernel updates

It should be noted that unlike the [Raspberry Pi](/index.php/Raspberry_Pi "Raspberry Pi") kernels that boot **without** an initramfs, the AArch64 kernels (kirkwood and linux-odroid-c2 for example) **do require an initramfs** which is generated by mkinitcpio just like Arch x86_64 or i686\. Upon updates, it is known that mkinitcpio does not detect ARM kernel modules and as such, will display following warnings which are harmless:

```
-> Running build hook: [base]
-> Running build hook: [udev]
-> Running build hook: [autodetect]
find: ‘/sys/devices/platform/’: No such file or directory
-> Running build hook: [modconf]
...
-> Running build hook: [fsck]
==> WARNING: No modules were added to the image. This is probably not what you want.

```

## General quirkiness

### Bridge interfaces do not work as expected

Is is known that both the ODROID-C1+ and ODROID-C2 (perhaps others) have a limitation with network bridges hypothesized to be due to the currently supported, but [old 3.14.x series of kernels](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4945#issuecomment-268596134). The limitation is that established network tools such as [netctl](/index.php/Netctl "Netctl") and [systemd-networkd](/index.php/Systemd-networkd "Systemd-networkd") cannot create and bring up a usable network bridge needed for linux containers among other things.

One solution is to use [odroid-auto-bridge](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/odroid-auto-bridge/) which will setup the bridge automatically using a discrete systemd service. This bridge can then be managed by systemd-netword or netctl (others too). See the [upsteam readme](https://github.com/graysky2/odroid-auto-bridge) for more.

### DHCP assignments to LXCs do not work as expected

Running linux containers on an ODROID host is quirky. In addition to the difficulties with network bridging described above, users will need to change the default forwarding policy on the host OS to allow for DHCP requests to the containers to work properly. Alternatively, users can use implement a static IP setup for containers.

Users wishing to retain the DHCP functionality need to install [ufw](/index.php/Ufw "Ufw") and configure it (see [Uncomplicated_Firewall#Basic_configuration](/index.php/Uncomplicated_Firewall#Basic_configuration "Uncomplicated Firewall")) on the host OS, Beyond the standard configuration, modify `/etc/default/ufw` as follows:

 `/etc/default/ufw`  `DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"` 

Failure to do so will result in an non-function DHCP assignment within the container even if users create a ufw rule or profile that specifically allows ports 67 and 68.

## CPU scaling and temperature management

### Headless mode for the C2

For servers (ie no need for a display), one can uncomment the following in `/boot/boot.ini` to free up approx 300 M of memory at the cost of disabling the video subsystem:

```
setenv nographics "1"

```

### CPU frequency scaling

The [cpupower](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=cpupower) package can be used to select alternative CPU governors for power savings. Edit `/etc/default/cpupower` and set the *governor=* line followed by [start](/index.php/Start "Start") cpupower.service.

#### Show online/offline cores

If using the *hotplug* governor, idle cores are switched off to reduce power consumption and heat generation.

```
lscpu |grep line

```

## Onboard hardware sensors

### CPU temperature

```
awk '{printf "%3.1f°C
", $1/1000}' /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp

```

### CPU frequency

```
awk '{printf "%3.1f MHz
", $1/1000}' /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq

```

### CPU governor

```
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

```

### Lightweight monitoring suite

[monitorix](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/monitorix/) has specific support for the the ODROID since v3.8.2 through the `gensens = y` setting in `/etc/monitorix/monitorix.conf`. Core temperature and CPU frequency are logged; screenshots available [here](http://www.monitorix.org/screenshots.html).

## Hardware tweaks

### CPU Fan

The optional CPU fan can be controlled via the `/sys/devices/platform/odroidu2-fan` interface.

#### Fan Mode

 `# echo auto > /sys/devices/platform/odroidu2-fan/fan_mode`  `# echo manual > /sys/devices/platform/odroidu2-fan/fan_mode` 

#### Fan Speed (Manual Only)

Values range from 0 (0%) to 255 (100%)

 `# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/odroidu2-fan/pwm_duty`  `# echo 255 > /sys/devices/platform/odroidu2-fan/pwm_duty` 

### LEDs

Several ODROID models have dual LEDs: a red power LED which is always on if power is supplied, and a blue LED which can be configured.

#### Blue LED

By default, the blue LED is a heartbeat LED, which flashes when the kernel is running. Depending on the model, this can be changed through the following..

*   ODROID-C2: `/sys/class/leds/blue:heartbeat/trigger`
*   ODROID-U3: `/sys/class/leds/led1/trigger`

##### List available triggers

 `# cat /sys/class/leds/blue:heartbeat/trigger`  `none rc-feedback nand-disk timer oneshot [heartbeat] backlight gpio cpu0 cpu1 cpu2 cpu3 default-on transient flash torch sd emmc battery-charging-or-full battery-charging battery-full battery-charging-blink-full-solid ac-online` 

##### Temporary configuration

Replace `*TRIGGER*` with one of the available triggers. This setting will apply instantly, but be lost upon reboot.

 `# echo *TRIGGER* > /sys/class/leds/blue:heartbeat/trigger` 

##### Permanent configuration

Replace `*TRIGGER*` with one of the available triggers. This setting will apply upon reboot.

 `/etc/tmpfiles.d/leds.conf`  `w /sys/class/leds/blue:heartbeat/trigger - - - - *TRIGGER*`
