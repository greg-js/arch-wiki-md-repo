**.NET Core** is a new FOSS software framework from Microsoft for C#, Visual Basic, and F#. It is designed to be cross-platform, modular and apt for modern applications, as opposed to its predecessor, the .NET Framework.

## Installation

If you only want to run .NET Core managed applications, install the [dotnet-runtime](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dotnet-runtime) package.

To build apps with .NET Core, install [dotnet-sdk](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dotnet-sdk) as well.

Microsoft recommends using [Visual Studio Code](/index.php/Visual_Studio_Code "Visual Studio Code") , their [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)-based FOSS IDE, to build & debug .NET Core apps.
