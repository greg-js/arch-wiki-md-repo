**.NET Core** is a new FOSS software framework from Microsoft for C#, Visual Basic, and F#. It is designed to be cross-platform, modular and apt for modern applications, as opposed to its predecessor, the .NET Framework.

## Installation

**Warning:** The [dotnet-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-bin/) package is currently broken, because Microsoft's binaries are linked with an older version of [OpenSSL](/index.php/OpenSSL "OpenSSL") than what Arch currently ships. This will be fixed in .NET Core 2.0 according to [[1]](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md).

If you only want to run .NET Core managed applications, install the [dotnet](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet/) package. The package has a single dependency on the latest release of the .NET Core runtime package.

To build apps with .NET Core, install [dotnet-sdk-1.1](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-sdk-1.1/) or [dotnet-sdk-2.0](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-sdk-2.0/) as well.

Microsoft recommends using [Visual Studio Code](/index.php/Visual_Studio_Code "Visual Studio Code"), their [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)-based FOSS IDE, to build & debug .NET Core apps.
