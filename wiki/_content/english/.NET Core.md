**.NET Core** is a new FOSS software framework from Microsoft for C#, Visual Basic, and F#. It is designed to be cross-platform, modular and apt for modern applications, as opposed to its predecessor, the .NET Framework.

## Installation

If you only want to run .NET Core managed applications, [install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [dotnet-runtime](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dotnet-runtime) package.

To build apps with .NET Core, install [dotnet-sdk](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dotnet-sdk) as well.

Microsoft recommends using [Visual Studio Code](/index.php/Visual_Studio_Code "Visual Studio Code") , their [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)-based FOSS IDE, to build & debug .NET Core apps.

## Telemetry

Telemetry is enabled by default but can be disabled by [setting environment variable](/index.php/Environment_variables "Environment variables") `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1`ã€‚

## Troubleshooting

### "the required library libhostfxr.so could not be found" error

Some of the dotnet SDK tools (for example *libman*, *dotnet-watch* etc.) may expect you to have the environment variable `DOTNET_ROOT` pre-configured. If it's not, an error like this one could be observed: [[1]](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9114)

```
A fatal error occurred, the required library libhostfxr.so could not be found.
If this is a self-contained application, that library should exist in [/home/my_user/.dotnet/tools/.store/microsoft.web.librarymanager.cli/1.0.172/microsoft.web.librarymanager.cli/1.0.172/tools/netcoreapp2.1/any/].
If this is a framework-dependent application, install the runtime in the default location [/usr/share/dotnet] or use the DOTNET_ROOT environment variable to specify the runtime location.

```

The workaround is to manually export `DOTNET_ROOT` in your shell:

 `~/.bashrc`  `export DOTNET_ROOT=/opt/dotnet` 

### SDK specified could not be found

This is believed to caused by a conflict between the Mono and MSBuild SDK libs and the dotnet core ones. To fix this export the path manually in your shell (replacing the version number as necessary) e.g:

 `~/.bashrc`  `export MSBuildSDKsPath="/opt/dotnet/sdk/2.2.108/Sdks/";`
