**.NET Core** is a new FOSS software framework from Microsoft for C#, Visual Basic, and F#. It is designed to be cross-platform, modular and apt for modern applications, as opposed to its predecessor, the .NET Framework.

## Installation

If you only want to run .NET Core managed applications, [install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [dotnet-runtime](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dotnet-runtime) package.

To build apps with .NET Core, install [dotnet-sdk](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=dotnet-sdk) as well.

Microsoft recommends using [Visual Studio Code](/index.php/Visual_Studio_Code "Visual Studio Code") , their [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/)-based FOSS IDE, to build & debug .NET Core apps.

**Tip:** Add `~/.dotnet/tools` to `PATH`, otherwise dotnet tools will not work from shell.

### Install multiple versions

You can install multiple versions of the .NET Core SDK or runtime side by side by using the [dotnet-install.sh](https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh) script provided by the .NET Foundation. You can find the documentation of the script [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script).

For instance, this command would install the latest version found in the "current" channel in `/opt/dotnet`:

```
# ./dotnet-install.sh --install-dir /opt/dotnet -channel Current -version latest

```

You may want to simulate the installation first by using the `-Dryrun` flag.

Once installed, you can verify the SDKs available:

```
$ dotnet --list-sdks                                                                 
2.2.108 [/opt/dotnet/sdk]
3.0.100 [/opt/dotnet/sdk]
$ dotnet --version
3.0.100

```

## Telemetry

Telemetry is enabled by default but can be disabled by [setting environment variable](/index.php/Environment_variables "Environment variables") `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1`.

## Troubleshooting

### It was not possible to find any compatible framework version

If you get the following error when you try to run a newly created project, you no longer need to set a `DOTNET_ROOT` variable as described in the solutions of various github issues. Arch's dotnet package (as of 3.1) installs it to the Microsoft recommended location of `/usr/share/dotnet`.

 `$ dotnet run` 
```
It was not possible to find any compatible framework version
The framework 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App', version '3.1.0' was not found.
  - No frameworks were found.

You can resolve the problem by installing the specified framework and/or SDK.

The specified framework can be found at:
  - [https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.AspNetCore.App&framework_version=3.1.0&arch=x64&rid=arch-x64](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.AspNetCore.App&framework_version=3.1.0&arch=x64&rid=arch-x64)
```

This is caused because the runtime is shipped as a separate package in Arch. You just need to make sure you have the [aspnet-runtime](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=aspnet-runtime) package installed as well.

### "the required library libhostfxr.so could not be found" error

Some of the dotnet SDK tools (for example *libman*, *dotnet-watch* etc.) may expect you to have the environment variable `DOTNET_ROOT` pre-configured. If it's not, an error like this one could be observed: [[1]](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9114)

```
A fatal error occurred, the required library libhostfxr.so could not be found.
If this is a self-contained application, that library should exist in [/home/my_user/.dotnet/tools/.store/microsoft.web.librarymanager.cli/1.0.172/microsoft.web.librarymanager.cli/1.0.172/tools/netcoreapp2.1/any/].
If this is a framework-dependent application, install the runtime in the default location [/usr/share/dotnet] or use the DOTNET_ROOT environment variable to specify the runtime location.

```

The workaround is to manually export `DOTNET_ROOT` in your shell:

 `~/.bashrc`  `export DOTNET_ROOT=/opt/dotnet` 

### SDK specified could not be found

This is believed to caused by a conflict between the Mono and MSBuild SDK libs and the dotnet core ones. To fix this export the path manually in your shell (replacing the version number as necessary) e.g:

 `~/.bashrc`  `export MSBuildSDKsPath="/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/3.1.100/Sdks";`
