**.NET Core** is a new FOSS software framework from Microsoft for C#, Visual Basic, and F#. It is designed to be cross-platform, modular and apt for modern applications, as opposed to its predecessor, the .NET Framework.

## Installation

**Warning:** The [dotnet-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-bin/) package is currently broken, because Microsoft's binaries are linked with an older version of [OpenSSL](/index.php/OpenSSL "OpenSSL") than what Arch currently ships.

If you only want to run .NET Core managed applications, install [dotnet](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet/) and [dotnet-cli](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-cli/).

To build apps with .NET Core, install [dotnet-sdk](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotnet-sdk/) as well.

Microsoft recommends using [Visual Studio Code](/index.php/Visual_Studio_Code "Visual Studio Code"), their [Electron](/index.php/Electron "Electron")-based FOSS IDE, to build & debug .NET Core apps.

### OmniSharp dependencies in VS Code

Arch is not officially supported by the Dotnet SIG, and attempting to install dependencies via the C# extension (OmniSharp) may fail.[[1]](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Installing-the-.NET-Core-Debugger-on-Arch-Linux)

To fix this, install [icu57](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/icu57/), and in the VS Code settings, set "csharp.fallbackDebuggerLinuxRuntimeId" to "ubuntu.16.04-x64". After restarting VS Code, open a C# source file to begin installing dependencies.
