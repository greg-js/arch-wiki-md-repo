## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [pianobar](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=pianobar) package.

## Configuration

First, you need to create a configuration file for Pianobar. This should be located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pianobar/config` or `~/.config/pianobar/config`

 `$ man pianobar` 
```
CONFIGURATION
       The  configuration file consists of simple key = value lines, each ter‚Äê
       minated with a newline (
) character. Note that keys  and  values  are
       both  case  sensitive, and there must be exactly one space on each side
       of the equals sign.

       act_* keys control pianobar's key-bindings.  Every  one-byte  character
       except for \x00 and the special value disabled are allowed here.
```

Here is an example configuration file. See [pianobar(1)](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/pianobar.1) for more configuration options.

 `$ ~/.config/pianobar/config` 
```
audio_quality = {high, medium, low}
autostart_station = stationid

password = plaintext_password
user = your@user.name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Sound Quality Issues

If you are experiencing sound/quality issues when running pianobar, and you are currently using [ALSA](/index.php/ALSA "ALSA") as your sound driver, the following fixes may be useful.

**Warning:** The provided fixes may affect other applications that use audio as the default driver is being changed.

1.  Install [alsa-oss](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=alsa-oss). See the [ALSA](/index.php/ALSA "ALSA") page for more information.
    *   Change the default libao driver from alsa to oss.
    *   ```
        # /etc/libao.conf
        default_driver=oss
        ```

    *   Now run pianobar
        *   `$ aoss pianobar` 
2.  Alternatively, you can use pulseaudio.
    *   ```
        # /etc/libao.conf
        default_driver=pulse
        ```

**Note:** Be sure to remove the dev=default option of the alsa driver or adjust it to specify a specific Pulse sink name or number.

### Network Error

If you are receiving the "Network error: Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates", try adding the following line to your .config/pianobar/config file:

 `ca_bundle = /etc/ca-certificates/extracted/tls-ca-bundle.pem`
