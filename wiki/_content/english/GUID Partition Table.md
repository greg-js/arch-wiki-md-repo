GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a partitioning scheme that is part of the [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface](/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface") specification; it uses a [globally unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier "wikipedia:Globally unique identifier") for qualifying devices. It is the next generation partitioning scheme designed to succeed the [Master Boot Record](/index.php/Master_Boot_Record "Master Boot Record") partitioning scheme method. It evolved to deal with [several shortcomings](/index.php/Master_Boot_Record#Problems_with_MBR "Master Boot Record") of the MBR partitioning scheme method and offers additional advantages.
