## Hardware

### Thunderbolt 3

To use Thunderbolt 3, ensure you are on the latest BIOS firmware (doing the following steps on older BIOSes may brick your device):

1\. Go into BIOS

2\. Enable BIOS Assist mode: (Thunderbolt 3 -> Enable BIOS assist mode) *Ensure you're on the latest BIOS!*

### Battery

#### Invalid stats workaround

As of writing, [a bug exists](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1859876) where the battery data can appear corrupt, wildly incorrect, or seem to change drastically from boot to boot. To workaround this bug you should add battery to the `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`.

```
MODULES=(**battery**)

```

Remember to [regenerate the initramfs](/index.php/Regenerate_the_initramfs "Regenerate the initramfs") for these changes to take effect.

**Note:** You can also build the battery module into your kernel.

#### Battery life and graphics

[bbswitch does not work](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=238389) on this laptop to disable the NVIDIA card when not in use. To disable the NVIDIA card you can run:

```
# tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.1/remove <<<1
# tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.0/remove <<<1

```

**Note:** It may be much easier to just use optimus manager with the necessary power options described in [#Graphics](#Graphics)

### Graphics

#### Nouveau

Currently (5.2.9-arch1), the Nouveau driver can cause quite a lot of kernel panics when using the webcamera. You should blacklist this driver to prevent it from being loaded.

#### NVIDIA

##### Prime features

The NVIDIA driver now supports PRIME Offloading. [Following this guide](http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/primerenderoffload.html) you can try out this new mode. However, [external display ports will not work with only this method](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/nvidia-render-offloading-help-getting-external-monitor-working/99430/22).

##### Power Management

To get the best power options the graphics card may be configured to use low power mode by [following the guide here](http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/dynamicpowermanagement.html)

##### Optimus manager

Currently, one of the easiest solutions for this laptop is to use [optimus-manager](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager) with the hybrid backend. This requires the most up to date nvidia and xorg-server packages.

This allows easy switching between the PRIME offloading feature above, and a mode where external display ports (HDMI and USB-C) work.

### Audio

#### Audio pop on shutdown and startup

To work around the loud audio artifacts on startup/shutdown follow the guide for enabling the audio powersave: [Power management#Audio](/index.php/Power_management#Audio "Power management").

### Fingerprint

The 2.0 version of fprint [supports this device](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/issues/181) after a firmware update.

To get fingerprint working right now:

**Note:** The Firmware for this is still in the testing phase at LVFS. Proceed with caution.

Install the following packages available on the [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR")Â :

*   [libfprint-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libfprint-git/)
*   [fprintd-libfprint2](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fprintd-libfprint2/)

And setup [fwupd](/index.php/Fwupd "Fwupd")

The firmware updates currently require the newest version of fwupd and you must manually download the updates:

*   [https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devices/com.synaptics.prometheus.firmware](https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devices/com.synaptics.prometheus.firmware)
*   [https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devices/com.synaptics.prometheus.config](https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devices/com.synaptics.prometheus.config)

using the latest version of the fwupd tool you should be able to run:

```
$ fwupdmgr get-devices

```

and see a "Prometheus" device in the list.

Install the firmware by running

```
$ fwupdmgr install *.cab

```

on each downloaded .cab file

**Note:** At this point, a reboot may be required

You should then be able to enroll your fingerprints with [Fprint#Configuration](/index.php/Fprint#Configuration "Fprint")

**Note:** For some reason, [the fprint.service can take some time to start. if fprint reports no devices, wait until fprint.service has completely stopped (it should become inactive in systemctl) To fix this, reset the fingerprint data in your bios settings](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/issues/207)

### Webcam

The webcam in this laptop is capable of "Windows Hello" which has a Linux version called [Howdy](/index.php/Howdy "Howdy"). The device you should use to configure howdy on this laptop is `/dev/video0`.

## Firmware

BIOS and firmware updates are available via [fwupd](/index.php/Fwupd "Fwupd"), the Lenovo Vantage application on Windows, or from [Lenovo's website](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-x-series-laptops/thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-2/downloads).

The latest BIOS version, v1.26, is highly recommended. All information on this page generally assumes the latest BIOS unless explicitly stated.

## Software

### Throttling fix

You will see a dmesg error that talks about CPU throttling. To fix this install [throttled](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=throttled), then run

```
# systemctl enable --now lenovo_fix.service

```

### CPU undervolting

Undervolting the CPU/Intel GPU works well with [intel-undervolt](/index.php/Undervolting_CPU#intel-undervolt "Undervolting CPU").
