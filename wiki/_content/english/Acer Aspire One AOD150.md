This article pertains to the 10.1" Acer Aspire One D150 models made available in February 2009\. At this time, the AOD150 series feature standard SATA hard drives only, therefore much of the information found in the [Acer Aspire One](/index.php/Acer_Aspire_One "Acer Aspire One") article does not apply. This article attempts to trim the fat.

## Arch Installation

There are plenty of resources available to help new users install and configure a basic Arch Linux installation, including the [Installation guide](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide").

The obvious consideration for netbooks in general is the lack of CD/DVD drives. Unless you are using an external optical drive you will want to stick to the USB image of the Arch snapshots.

The following tips are specific to the Acer Aspire One (also referred as the AAO or AA1) and may be of some help during installation.

If a broadband Internet connection is available it is highly recommended that Arch be installed with the smaller FTP image. If you plan to have a desktop environment (KDE, GNOME, etc) then the majority of the packages you require will come from the Internet repositories and *not* the Arch USB itself. This method will get you up and running in the shortest amount of time. Simply download the FTP USB image, write to a USB drive and restart your computer.

The following steps assume you are connected to the Internet with a wired Ethernet connection.

## Hardware Configuration

### Kernel Drivers

The following kernels drivers are necessary to get all of the various hardware working. All of these modules should load automatically without adding them to **/etc/rc.conf**:

*   **atl1e** - Ethernet
*   **ath5k** - Wireless
*   **uvcvideo** - Webcam
*   **snd_hda_intel** - Audio

### Hotkeys

Many of the Function hotkeys are controlled via hardware/BIOS and do not require user configuration:

*   LCD Toggle (Fn+F6)
*   LCD Brightness (Fn+Left / Fn+Right)
*   Touchpad Toggle (Fn+F7)
*   Wireless Kill-switch (dedicated)

The remaining hotkeys can be configured easily with utilities (such as xbindkeys):

*   Volume Up/Down (Fn+Up / Fn+Down)
*   Mute (Fn+F8)
*   Standby (Fn+F4)

### Touchpad

The Synaptics touchpad is sometimes disabled by default, following a fresh installation. If unresponsive, try pressing the touchpad toggle hotkeys (Fn+F7).

In all other respects, the touchpad can be configured using the standard [Touchpad Synaptics](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics "Touchpad Synaptics") wiki.

## Kernel Drivers for Aspire One D250

The **atl1e** driver that ships with the kernel in 2009.02 does not work with the Atheros/Attansic ethernet chip in this model. The chip in the AAO D250 has device id 0x1062, and the default **atl1e** driver only supports the 0x1026 device. In order to get the wired ethernet working you have to compile another version of **atl1e**.

Go to [http://partner.atheros.com/Drivers.aspx](http://partner.atheros.com/Drivers.aspx) and fetch **[459]AR813X-linux-v1.0.0.9.tar.gz** from there. This driver supports a wide range of Atheros/Attansic devices. Do *not* fetch **AR81Family-linux-v1.0.1.0.tar.gz**, because that is the one that supports device id 0x1026 only.

Then compile and install the driver:

```
$ tar -xz < [459]AR813X-linux-v1.0.0.9.tar.gz
$ cd src
$ make

```

```
# cp atl1e.ko /lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/net

```

The last step requires being logged in as **root**. Reboot and the wired ethernet card should now be recognized on your D250.
