## Configuration

This article refers to the HP Folio 13 ultrabook. The model specifically is the dm3-1008TU, which is the i5 variant. An i3 variant is also available with otherwise the same hardware (13-1016TU). For more: [http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/folio13/index.html#.T3RIaNXK3co](http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/folio13/index.html#.T3RIaNXK3co)

### Installation

The Folio 13 lacks an optical drive, so you will need to create a USB install media and boot from the USB (hit F9 at startup to select USB as boot drive). The following notes refer to Arch x86_64 installed using a nightly netinstall ISO (March 17 nightly). As noted below, you will need to alter the kernel boot line in order to prevent the display from blacking out once the kernel loads. This applies to the install media and 1st boot once installation is done.

If you experience PGP package signing errors during the package download and install phase of installation, you may need to do the foloowing: after selecting packages, but before installing packages, go to TTY3 (Alt-F3), login as root, and edit /tmp/pacman.conf. Add the following line after "Architecture = auto" - SigLevel = Never. You may also need to generate pacman's signature keys using the command "pacman-key --init".

If you wish to have all 128GB of space available on the SSD, first backup the factory partition using HP's backup tool (available when you login to the pre-installed Win 7) - you will need a 16GB USB drive to do so. You can then totally wipe/repartition the SSD during Arch installation, with the 16GB USB available to do a factory reinstall (although why would you want to!?). Of course if you don't want a backup USB, go ahead and just repartition the drive.

### CPU

Works out of the box. See [CPU frequency scaling](/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling "CPU frequency scaling") for more information on power saving. Both cpufrequtils and cpupower work. Latter is recommended for additional features.

### Video

This laptop has integrated HD3000 Intel Video. Works with xorg-intel driver (see above). Plays HD video fine, no graphical anomalies on the desktop (gnome-shell tested). Visual effects work fine.

**Note:** In order to prevent the screen from turning off/black at startup, you need to add `i915.modeset=1 acpi_backlight=vendor` to [Kernel parameters](/index.php/Kernel_parameters "Kernel parameters")

As the brightness adjustment Fn keys don't work [updated: as of kernel 3.10 brightness and other Fn keys do all work], and the laptop defaults to 100% brightness, in order to save power and extend battery life, you may want to reduce the screen brightness at boot up. To do so, enter the following into /etc/rc.local:

 ` echo 3500 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness` 

The value '3500' can be adjusted higher or lower (increasing or decreasing brightness respectively) as preferred. '3500' corresponds to around 75%.

### Audio

Works out of the box, including built-in microphone (good for your Skype!).

#### HDMI

Works out of the box.

### Touchpad

More correctly, the HP Folio has what is known as a clickpad i.e. no actual physical buttons exist. It mostly works out of the box with a few niggles: the pointer can jump around a bit (this seems improved in recent drivers) and the button areas are quite stiff (it does improve with use).

The right-click area on the clickpad does not work out of the box - although the xf86-input-synaptics driver (in [Extra]) supports right-click functionality with a small edit to the config file as per the Synaptics Arch Wiki [Touchpad Synaptics#Buttonless touchpads (aka ClickPads)](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Buttonless_touchpads_.28aka_ClickPads.29 "Touchpad Synaptics").

You can also enable two-finger tap gesture as right-click functionality, but this can be annoying when trying to two-finger scroll and an accidental right-click is triggered - YMMV. A third way of restoring a right-click button is to install the xf86-input-synaptics-led package from the AUR[[1]](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57575).

Finally, there is currently no functionality to enable/disable the trackpad by double-tapping the top left corner of the pad (a function provided for by the windows drivers). The LED light of the clickpad also doesn't work (even using the synaptics-led package [[2]](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=49284) from AUR).

*UPDATE:* As of 21/5/12, the default xf86-input-synaptics does have 1-button click (either left or right) + drag functionality restored. This means, for example, that you can left-click and drag to select text and right-click and drag to perform mouse gestures (assuming you have enabled the right button as above).

### Suspend to RAM

Suspending manually (pm-suspend) works, comes back with all devices OK. Lid switch ACPI events do not work. However, the state of the lid is reported in the file `/proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state.` Though this is not the preferred way to manage services, it is possible to read this file in an infinite loop and trigger a command to sleep or hibernate when the lid is closed. An example script might look like this:

```
 #!/bin/bash

 delay_time="2.5"
 cmd="pm-hibernate"

 while trueÂ ; do
   state=( $(</proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state) )
   [[ ${state[1]} = "closed" ]] && $cmd
   sleep $delay_time
 done

```

Save this file to `/usr/local/bin/lid` and mark as executable with:

```
 # chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lid`

```

It is preferable to run this script as a daemon (see [systemd](/index.php/Systemd "Systemd")). Alternatively, it is possible to launch this in userspace, such as in ~/.xinitrc or other startup system. If so, the `cmd` variable may need to be prefixed with `sudo` and one must allow the command to be executed by a regular user as detailed at [Pm-utils#Suspend/hibernate as regular user](/index.php/Pm-utils#Suspend.2Fhibernate_as_regular_user "Pm-utils"). Users may increase the delay_time to decrease system calls or change the command to be executed when the lid is closed.

This is a hacky solution, only to be used, if at all, until acpid registers lid events. Nonetheless, the HP Folio 13 is sufficiently powerful that the extra load created by checking a file every few seconds has no perceptible impact on the user experience.

### Webcam

Works out of the box.

### Function Keys

Mostly work. The screen brightness function keys don't work and neither does the wireless on-off key. The sound level/mute and keyboard backlight on-off keys do all work.

Update: the sound level/mute keys no longer seem to work with kernel 3.6.x. This is a known bug related to GNOME, and has a fix in GNOME 3.6 [testing] as of 19/10/12.

Update 29 July 2013: Function keys now all work. This update/fix appeared around kernel 3.10.

### Bluetooth

Does not work out of the box. You will need to add the following to /etc/rc.local:

```
modprobe btusb &&
echo "0a5c 21e3" >> /sys/bus/usb/drivers/btusb/new_id

```

Finally, you will need to add 'bluetooth' to your rc.conf daemons.

### Wireless

The Broadcom BCM4313 suffers from a very weak wireless signal when using the stock out-of-the-box 'brcmsmac' driver and is a known bug. In order to get normal, useable wireless strength back, you will need to blacklist the following modules by creating a file '/etc/modprobe.d/broadcom-wl.conf'and editing it to read:

```
blacklist b43
blacklist bcma
blacklist ssb
blacklist brcmsmac

```

Using the wired ethernet connection, install 'broadcom-wl' from AUR. There is no need to edit the modules line in rc.conf, it should load the wl driver automagically.

Your particular model may use an Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1030, which uses the iwlwifi kernel module. This may not work in NetworkManager, if so, try wicd.

As of kernel 3.16, the native kernel "brcmsmac" driver fixed the above problem of a weak wireless signal.
