From the [project web page](http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki):

_Gobby is a free collaborative editor supporting multiple documents in one session and a multi-user chat._ It uses GTK+ 2 as its windowing toolkit and thus integrates nicely into the GNOME desktop environment.

## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [gobby](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=gobby) package. To run the Infininote server protocol without the Gobby front end install [libinfinity](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=libinfinity)

## Infininote Usage

To start the server portion, run

```
/usr/bin/infinoted-0.6 --security-policy=no-tls

```

The server only needs to be running on one machine.

Then, run the gobby client and connect to the server via IP or localhost.

If youâ€™d rather have encryption, TLS is available. Use:

```
infinoted-0.6 --create-key --create-certificate -k key.pem  -c cert.pem

```

The keys creation is automatic, and you can launch the server just using:

```
infinoted-0.6 -k key.pem  -c cert.pem

```
