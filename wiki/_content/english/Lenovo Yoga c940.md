## Overview

Most functionality works out of the box, a kernel of version 5.4 is recommended due to Ice Lake's new Thunderbolt.

| **Device** | **Status** | **Modules** |
| Graphics | **Working** | i915 |
| Wireless | **Working** | iwlwifi |
| Audio | **Partially Working** | snd_hda_intel |
| Touchscreen | **Working** | wacom |
| Stylus | **Working** ยน | wacom,usbhid |
| Accelerometer | **Working** | hid_sensor_accel_3d |
| Touchpad | **Working** | psmouse |
| Camera | **Working** | uvcvideo |
| Bluetooth | **Working** | btintel |
| Fingerprint Reader | **Not Working** |

## Installation

Newer kernels boot without problems and the wifi should be available. If you get a blank screen after booting, the power modes are not supported by your kernel; refer to Troubleshooting.

### Booting the install USB

To access the boot menu and BIOS, use "F1". Disable secure boot from the BIOS. UEFI boot mode works fine.

## Configuration

### TrackPad

TrackPad works fine with [xf86-input-synaptics](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-synaptics).

### TouchScreen and Stylus

Touchscreen works with the Wacom driver (package: [xf86-input-wacom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-wacom)). Also using the Stylus, the bottom button of the pen is defined as the eraser and the top button works as a middle mouse button

**Note:** See [Tablet PC](/index.php/Tablet_PC "Tablet PC") for more info on optimizing the touchscreen experience.

### Video

The kernel supports Iris Plus Gen11 from version 5.3\. With default configuration, tearing is apparent when playing videos. To fix tearing, create the file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` with the following content:

```
Section "Device"
   Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
   Driver      "intel"
   Option      "TearFree"    "true"
EndSection

```

That said there seems to be issues with Chromium based GPU acceleration, so either disabling that via Chromium flags, or removing [xf86-video-intel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-intel). Although you will face some tearing unless using [compton](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=compton) or [picom](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=picom).

### Audio

Audio works when using the snd_hda_intel driver, so make a file in `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf` with

```
options snd_hda_intel enable=1 index=1

```

However Audio is partially working as there are some limitations.

#### Microphone

Microphone requires the new SOF firmware, I've not experimented with this so I can't really say anything to that.

Bug reports for Microphone

*   [https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201251](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201251)
*   [https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/issues/2134](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/issues/2134)

#### Speakers

Audio is OK, there are 5.1 speakers, 2.1 in the soundbar, and 2 under the palmrest on either side of the laptop. Only the 2 speakers in the soundbar works, and not the subwoofer. This isn't optimal, but Alsa/Pulseaudio report that its a 2 channel audio device. I have read in other articles from other Lenovo devices, like the X1 Yoga that they solve this by making the alsa/pulseaudio use 4 channels instead of 2.. I haven't tried this so I cannot report on it.

Thread on Alsa-devel about 5.1 speakers [https://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2018-November/142369.html](https://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2018-November/142369.html)

### Bluetooth

The Bluetooth adapter works out of the box.

### Screen Rotation

I personally use [bspwm](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=bspwm) and for that I use [iio-sensor-proxy](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=iio-sensor-proxy) and [screenrotator-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/screenrotator-git/). But theres a whole article on this in [Tablet_PC](/index.php/Tablet_PC "Tablet PC").

## ACPI

Suspend on lid works.

Manual fan control does not work at all.

## Troubleshooting

Most of the difficulty is getting screen rotation, sound, and the microphone to work. Other issues like Chromium/Electron apps being slow, or graphics weirdness can be solved by uninstalling the [xf86-video-intel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-intel) package
