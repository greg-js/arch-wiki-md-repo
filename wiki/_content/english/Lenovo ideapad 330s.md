## Hardware Support

### UEFI

Before installing, disable [Secure Boot](/index.php/Secure_Boot "Secure Boot") in the BIOS. You can access the BIOS by pressing F2 at the Splash screen. The boot menu can also be accessed by pressing F12.

### Video

X works natively with a current [linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=linux) and [xf86-video-amdgpu](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-amdgpu).

### Sound

Sound works.

### Webcam

Works out of the box.

### Ethernet

(No RJ45, use any working USB (A or C) dongle.)

### Wireless

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work.

### Touchpad

Doesn't work by default and prevents the system from booting. Add `ivrs_ioapic[32]=00:14.0` to the kernel command line arguments to make it work, and to be able to boot. You need to add this parameter to the kernel command line arguments for the live image as well.
