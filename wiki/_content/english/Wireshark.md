## Installation

[Install](/index.php/Install "Install") the [wireshark-qt](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=wireshark-qt) package for the Wireshark GUI or [wireshark-cli](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=wireshark-cli) for just the `tshark` CLI.

**Note:** The deprecated GTK interface has been removed in Wireshark 3.0.

## Capturing privileges

Do not run Wireshark as root, it is insecure. Wireshark has implemented privilege separation [[1]](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/CapturePrivileges#Most_UNIXes).

The [wireshark-cli](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=wireshark-cli) [install script](/index.php/PKGBUILD#install "PKGBUILD") sets packet capturing [capabilities](/index.php/Capabilities "Capabilities") on the `/usr/bin/dumpcap` executable.

`/usr/bin/dumpcap` can only be executed by root and members of the `wireshark` group, therefore to use Wireshark as a normal user you have to add your user to the `wireshark` [user group](/index.php/User_group "User group") (see [Users and groups#Group management](/index.php/Users_and_groups#Group_management "Users and groups")).

## A few capturing techniques

There are a number of different ways to capture exactly what you are looking for in Wireshark, by applying [capture filters](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureFilters) or [display filters](https://wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters).

**Note:** To learn the capture filter syntax, see [pcap-filter(7)](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/pcap-filter.7). For display filters, see [wireshark-filter(4)](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/wireshark-filter.4).

### Filtering TCP packets

If you want to see all the current TCP packets, type `tcp` into the "Filter" bar or in the CLI, enter:

```
$ tshark -f "tcp"

```

### Filtering UDP packets

If you want to see all the current UDP packets, type `udp` into the "Filter" bar or in the CLI, enter:

```
$ tshark -f "udp"

```

### Filter packets to a specific IP address

*   If you would like to see all the traffic going to a specific address, enter display filter `ip.dst == 1.2.3.4`, replacing `1.2.3.4` with the IP address the outgoing traffic is being sent to.
*   If you would like to see all the incoming traffic for a specific address, enter display filter `ip.src == 1.2.3.4`, replacing `1.2.3.4` with the IP address the incoming traffic is being sent to.
*   If you would like to see all the incoming and outgoing traffic for a specific address, enter display filter `ip.addr == 1.2.3.4`, replacing `1.2.3.4` with the relevant IP address.

### Exclude packets from a specific IP address

```
ip.addrÂ != 1.2.3.4

```

### Filter packets to LAN

To only see LAN traffic, no internet traffic run

```
ip.src==192.168.0.0/16 and ip.dst==192.168.0.0/16

```

### Filter packets by port

See all traffic on 2 ports or more:

```
tcp.port==80||tcp.port==3306
tcp.port==80||tcp.port==3306||tcp.port==443

```
