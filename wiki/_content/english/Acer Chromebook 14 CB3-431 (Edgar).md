**Warning:** This article assumes the reader is willing to replace ChromeOS with Arch Linux.

The following article briefly explains all necessary procedures to install a fully-functional Arch Linux configuration on the Acer Chromebook 14 cb3-431 (Edgar).

## Write Protection

Write Protection does not have to be voided to follow this guideline.

## Developer Mode

Prior to the installation, certain actions must be taken to grant bios reading permission on unsigned installation mediums. This includes enabling [Developer Mode](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/acer-c720-chromebook#TOC-Developer-Mode), and flashing a custom SeaBios.

**Warning:** Enabling Developer Mode will wipe all of your data.

Enabling Developer Mode:

1.  Power off your machine.
2.  Enter recovery mode by holding down `Esc+F3` (Refresh) during boot.
3.  Once greeted in recovery mode (large yellow exclamation mark) press `Ctrl+d`.
4.  You will be prompted for confirmation, press enter to confirm developer mode.
5.  The device will reset and greet the user with a warning screen on every boot, that can be skipped by pressing `Ctrl+d`.

## Flashing a custom SeaBios

A custom SeaBios is required to load unsigned or self-signed installation mediums, in our case, being the Arch Linux Installation Media.

In ChromeOS, estasblish internet connection and enter the superuser shell with `Ctrl+Alt+F2` using the `chronos` username. Then obtain MrChromeBox's SeaBios utility:

```
# curl -L -O https://mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh

```

Execute the firmware utility:

```
# sudo bash firmware-util.sh

```

Select option 1 to Install RW_LEGACY, permitting booting from an external installation media from SeaBios.

Before selecting the reboot option and proceeding to the next part, ensure an Arch Linux Installation Media is inserted.

## Installation

### Booting the Installation Media

During the white "OS verification disabled" screen, toggle `Ctrl+l` to enter SeaBios. Then press the `Esc` key to load the boot menu, and select your external installation media.

Unless the installation media runs on a Linux version 4.8.14 or prior, the internal keyboard, sound, and trackpad will not function during the installation. From this point on, proceed with the official [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide).

**Note:** If SeaBios has immediately attempted to load from the internal disk, or simply ignored the `Esc` key boot menu request, the device has been fully shut down prior to the SeaBios load. SeaBios must be entered on reboot from ChromeOS to enter the Boot Menu

### Post installation

Unless RW protection has been voided and SeaBios has been set to boot as default, booting into grub is only possible by toggling `Ctrl+l` during the white "OS verification disabled" screen on boot.

## Fixes

Due to the recentness and unpopularity of the new Intel Braswell Chipset, a fair amount of issues must be fixed manually.

The following features are not expected to work out of boxÂ :

*   Internal Keyboard
*   Trackpad
*   Sound/Audio

Fixing those issues will require the user to compile and apply the patched [linux-galliumos-braswell](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-galliumos-braswell/) kernel and follow the proceeding steps below:

### Internal Keyboard

The internal keyboard becomes fully functional after the kernel has been patched, with the exception of hotkeys, which must be configured trough the [xkeyboard-config-chromebook](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xkeyboard-config-chromebook/) package.

### Sound

To fix audio/sound output, install the [galliumos-braswell-config](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/galliumos-braswell-config/) package using the `pacman --force` parameter.

### Trackpad

To fix trackpad pressure sensitivity issues for the [xf86-input-synaptics](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-input-synaptics) driver, add the following configuration file under `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf`

 `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf` 
```
Section "InputClass"
	Identifier "touchpad catchall"
	Driver "synaptics"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
	Option "FingerLow" "1"
	Option "FingerHigh" "5"
EndSection

```

For [libinput](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=libinput) support, add the following hwdb configuration under `/etc/udev/hwdb.d/99-touchpad-pressure.hwdb`

 `/etc/udev/hwdb.d/99-touchpad-pressure.hwdb` 
```
libinput:name:*Elan Touchpad:dmi:*svnGOOGLE:*pnEdgar*
 LIBINPUT_ATTR_PRESSURE_RANGE=1:15

```

After the XServer has been restarted, the changes will take place
