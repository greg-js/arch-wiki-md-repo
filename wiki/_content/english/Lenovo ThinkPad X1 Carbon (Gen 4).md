### Fingerprint Reader

The fingerprint reader included with this model `138a:0090 Validity Sensors, Inc` currently lacks a linux driver. [libfprint bugreport](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94536). Synaptics (which has acquired 'Validity Sensors') has unofficially said that they cannot disclose the protocol, but may possibly release a binary driver.

Open source Linux driver is being developed by reverse engineering the Windows driver. [[1]](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90)
