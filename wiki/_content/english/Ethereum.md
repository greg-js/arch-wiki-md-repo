### Ethereum Wallet

The Ethereum Wallet is currently not in the Arch repositories.

*   You can download it from Github [here](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases). Use the most recent Linux release with the zip extension: Ethereum-Wallet-linux64-<<version>>.zip

*   Unzip the file

*   Run ./ethereumwallet from the command-line.

*   If the application fails to start with error "error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", install package "gtk2".

The wallet also implements an Ethereum node.
