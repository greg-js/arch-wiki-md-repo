## Clients

### Ethereum Wallet

You can install the Ethereum Wallet via the [mist](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mist/) package or the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases).

If you use a GitHub release, download the most recent Linux one with the zip extension: `Ethereum-Wallet-linux64-*version*.zip`; unzip the file and run `./ethereumwallet`.

If the application fails to start with `error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`, install the [GTK+ 2](/index.php/GTK%2B "GTK+") library.

The wallet also implements an Ethereum node.
