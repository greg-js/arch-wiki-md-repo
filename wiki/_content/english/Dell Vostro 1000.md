## Problems

### "Unknown Key Pressed"

*   You may occasionally run across an error (occurring in an extremely high frequency) in your messages.log/dmesg:

```
 atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0xee on isa0060/serio0).
 atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e06e <keycode>' to make it known.

```

*   The fix for this issue is fairly simple. Power down your dell laptop, and reseat the battery.
*   Another possible cause may be due to your AC adapter being unplugged from the outlet, yet attached to the back of your laptop.
*   Yet another suggested fix for the problem is updating your BIOS.. but since this is an extreme measure (found on the ubuntu forums.. so take it with a grain of salt), try the first two solutions before moving on to this potentially dangerous measure.

### High Temperature

After the installation you will see that the temperature is around 60Â°C (Too High). You can get the temperature through:

```
cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature

```

or

```
cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM/temperature

```

This is because the CPU frequency is at full usage always... so before continuing with the install process install **cpufrequtils**, you can see further details on [Cpufrequtils](/index.php/Cpufrequtils "Cpufrequtils")

*   Note: using lm_sensors 'sensors' utility, k8temp-pci-00c3 reports much more reasonable temperatures (more along the lines of what windows reports) compared to this Virtual Thermal Zone. [I](/index.php?title=User:Igneous&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Igneous (page does not exist)") have noticed no issues running without cpu scaling while on AC.

## Installation

Follow the [Installation guide](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide").

## Xorg

Follow [Xorg](/index.php/Xorg "Xorg"), [Touchpad Synaptics](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics "Touchpad Synaptics") and [Extra keyboard keys](/index.php/Extra_keyboard_keys "Extra keyboard keys").

## Wireless

Follow [Wireless network configuration](/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration "Wireless network configuration") and [Broadcom wireless](/index.php/Broadcom_wireless "Broadcom wireless").

### Resume not working after suspend to RAM

To workaround this issue edit the file `/boot/grub/menu.lst` and add the following to the kernel boot line: `hpet=disable`
