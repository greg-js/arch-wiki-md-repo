*   [Server](/index.php/Server "Server")

From [Wikipedia:Virtual private server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server "wikipedia:Virtual private server"):

	Virtual private server (VPS) is a term used by Internet hosting services to refer to a virtual machine. The term is used for emphasizing that the virtual machine, although running in software on the same physical computer as other customers' virtual machines, is in many respects functionally equivalent to a separate physical computer, is dedicated to the individual customer's needs, has the privacy of a separate physical computer, and can be configured to run server software.

This article discusses the use of Arch Linux on Virtual Private Servers, and includes some fixes and installation instructions specific to VPSes.

**Warning:**

*   Since many container-based virtualization environments rely on older kernels, it may be impossible to keep an Arch Linux install up-to-date in such an environment. Linux 2.6.32, used by OpenVZ 6, is not supported by systemd since version 205 (and will not work with systemd-212 or higher). OpenVZ does sometimes backport newer kernel features into its kernel, but as of 2018-06-27, a fresh installation of Arch does not work on OpenVZ 6 kernel version 2.6.32-042stab131.1 . Arch can be installed on OpenVZ 7, with [a minor workaround](#Preparing_the_Arch_build_for_use_on_an_OpenVZ_7_container), as of OpenVZ 7 kernel version 3.10.0-693-21.1.vz7.48.2 .

## Providers that offer Arch Linux

**Warning:** We cannot vouch for the honesty or quality of any provider. Please conduct due diligence before ordering.

**Note:** This list is for providers with a convenient Arch Linux template. Using Arch on other providers is possible but requires more work. Example methods include:

*   Loading custom disc images (requires hardware virtualization such as in Xen or KVM),
*   [Installing under chroot](/index.php/Installation_guide "Installation guide"), for example with the help of the [vps2arch](https://gitlab.com/drizzt/vps2arch/) script (it will download the latest iso; be particularly aware of the systemd 220/221 [bug](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/421)), or
*   Following [#Installing the latest Arch Linux on any OpenVZ container provider](#Installing_the_latest_Arch_Linux_on_any_OpenVZ_container_provider) instructions, using rsync to synchronize Arch over the top of another distribution.

## Installation

### KVM

See [QEMU#Preparing an (Arch) Linux guest](/index.php/QEMU#Preparing_an_.28Arch.29_Linux_guest "QEMU").

### OpenVZ

#### Installing the latest Arch Linux on any OpenVZ container provider

**Warning:** See the [above warning](#top) about older kernel versions and systemd, and note the [workaround for OpenVZ 7 below](#Preparing_the_Arch_build_for_use_on_an_OpenVZ_7_container).

It is possible to directly copy an installation of Arch Linux over the top of a working OpenVZ VPS. This tutorial explains how to create a basic installation of Arch Linux with `pacstrap` (as used in a standard install) and then replace the contents of a target VPS with it using [rsync](/index.php/Rsync "Rsync").

This process (with minor modification) also works to migrate existing Arch installations between various environments and has been confirmed to work in migrating from OpenVZ to Xen and from Xen to OpenVZ. For an install to Xen, other hardware-virtualized platforms, or even to physical hardware, extra steps (basically running `mkinitcpio` and installing a [boot loader](/index.php/Boot_loader "Boot loader")) are needed.

##### Prerequisites

*   A working Arch Linux installation
    *   To keep things simple, it should match the architecture you want to install on your VPS (x86_64 or i686).
    *   To build from other distributions, [arch-bootstrap.sh](/index.php/Archbootstrap "Archbootstrap") can be used in place of `pacstrap`.
*   The [arch-install-scripts](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=arch-install-scripts), [rsync](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=rsync), and [openssh](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=openssh) packages from the [official repositories](/index.php/Official_repositories "Official repositories")
    *   SSH is not strictly required, but rsync over SSH is the method used here.
*   A VPS running any distribution, with `rsync` and a working SSH server
    *   Its architecture (x86_64 or i686) does not matter as long as the OpenVZ installation can support your target architecture.
*   OpenVZ's serial console feature (usually accessible via your provider's control panel)
    *   Without this, any network configuration for the target VPS will have to be done immediately after the "Build" step below.

##### Building a clean Arch Linux installation

As root, build the installation (optionally replacing `build` with your preferred target directory):

```
# mkdir build
# pacstrap -cd build

```

Other tweaks for the `pacstrap` command:

*   `-C custom-pacman-config.conf` - Use a custom pacman configuration file. By default, `pacstrap` builds according to your local pacman.conf. This determines the architecture (i686 or x86_64) of the build, the mirror list, etc.
*   `-G` - Prevent `pacstrap` from copying your system's pacman keyring to the new build. If you use this option, you will need to run `pacman-key --init` and `pacman-key --populate archlinux` in the [Configuration](#Configuration) step to set up the keyring.
*   `-M` - Prevent `pacstrap` from copying your system's pacman mirror list to the new build.
*   You can pass a list of packages to `pacstrap` to add them to your install, instead of the default `base` group. For example: `pacstrap -cd build base openssh dnsutils gnu-netcat traceroute vim`

###### Preparing the Arch build for use on an OpenVZ 7 container

OpenVZ 7 will fail to start a container if some expected network configuration files don't exist. The easiest way to get around this is as follows:

1.  Create the OpenVZ 7 container as Debian 8 (Debian 9 would probably work as well).
2.  Create the required blank network configuration files inside the Arch build, as follows:

```
# mkdir build/etc/network
# touch build/etc/network/interfaces
# mkdir -p build/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d
# touch build/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base

```

##### Replacing everything on the VPS with the Arch build

Replace all files, directories, etc. on your target VPS with the contents of your `build` directory (replacing "YOUR.VPS.IP.ADDRESS" below):

**Warning:** Be careful with the following command. By design, `rsync` is very destructive, especially with any of the `--delete` options.

```
# rsync -axH --numeric-ids --delete-delay -e ssh --stats -P build/ YOUR.VPS.IP.ADDRESS:/

```

Explanation of options:

*   `-a` - Required. Preserves timestamps, permissions, etc.
*   `--delete` - Required. Deletes anything in the target that does not exist in the source
*   `-x` - Important. Prevents the crossing of filesystem boundaries (other partitions, /dev, etc.) during the copy
*   `-H` - Important. Preserves hardlinks
*   `--numeric-ids` - Important. Doesn't assign user/group ownership of files based on matching user and group names and instead uses the numeric IDs directly, ensuring proper file ownership on the target system
*   `--delete-delay` - Recommended. Enables alternate deletion mode which waits to delete anything until the synchronization is otherwise complete, which may reduce the risk of a slow transfer causing the target VPS to lock-up
*   `-e ssh` - Recommended. Uses `rsync` over SSH (recommended for simplicity compared to setting up an `rsync` server)
*   `-P` - Recommended. Shows partial progress information during transfer
*   `--stats` - Recommended. Shows transfer statistics at the end

##### Configuration

1.  Reboot the VPS externally (using your provider's control panel, for example).
2.  Using OpenVZ's serial console feature, configure the [network](/index.php/Network "Network") and [basic system settings](/index.php/Installation_guide#Configure_the_system "Installation guide") (ignoring fstab generation and arch-chroot steps).
    *   If you do not have access to the serial console feature, you will need to preconfigure your network settings before synchronizing Arch to the VPS.
    *   On some VPS configuration you won't have a gateway to connect to, here is an example [netctl](/index.php/Netctl "Netctl") configuration for this setup. It configures static IP addresses and default routes on venet0 and uses Google Public DNS.

 `/etc/netctl/venet` 
```
Description='VPS venet connection'
Interface=venet0
Connection=ethernet

IP=static
Address=('192.0.2.42/32')
Routes=('default')

IP6=static
Address6=('2001:db8::1234:5678/128')
Routes6=('default')

DNS=('2001:4860:4860::8888' '2001:4860:4860::8844' '8.8.8.8' '8.8.4.4')
```

### Xen

See [Xen](/index.php/Xen "Xen").
