[Yousician](http://www.yousician.com/) is a proprietary software that aims to teach you guitar, piano, bass and ukulele.

## Installation

A [yousician](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yousician/) package is available, though unsafe because it uses a world-writable `/opt` folder.

You must have an [account](https://app.yousician.com/signup) to use this app.

Yousician is built on [Unity3D](/index.php/Unity3D "Unity3D") and also needs [Clang](/index.php/Clang "Clang") to work properly.

## Troubleshooting

Errors are logged in `~/.config/unity3d/Yousician/Yousician/Player.log`.
