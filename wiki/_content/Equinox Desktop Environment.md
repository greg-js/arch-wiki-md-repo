# Equinox Desktop Environment

The [Equinox Desktop Environment (EDE)](http://equinox-project.org/) is a DE designed to be simple, extremely light-weight and fast.

It primarily offers the most basic things: A window manager ([PekWM](/index.php/PekWM "PekWM") is used by default), a simple GUI including a panel, a daemon watching removable media and a notification daemon. Other than that there's not much more than some configuration progams, a calculator, etc. Beginning with version 2.0, EDE follows the FreeDesktop.org guidelines.

Unlike any other desktop environment, EDEÂ² is based upon the [FLTK toolkit](http://fltk.org). It's especially fit for systems with little RAM or for users who want to completely customize their system and need a GUI that is not already bloated with functions and applications.

## Installation

EDE is not very a very common piece of software. You usually have to compile it yourself. For Arch Linux there are however pre-built packages available via a [custom repository](/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories "Unofficial user repositories").

### Installation (packages)

To enable EDE's repository, just add the following lines to your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

```
[ede]
SigLevel = Optional
Server = http://ede.elderlinux.org/repos/archlinux/$arch

```

Next [refresh the package lists](/index.php/Mirrors#Force_pacman_to_refresh_the_package_lists "Mirrors") and [install](/index.php/Install "Install") the EDE packages via [pacman](/index.php/Pacman "Pacman"):

*   _edelib_
*   _ede-common_
*   _ede_
*   _ede-wallpapers_ (optional)

### Installation (AUR)

You can also build EDE yourself. Fortunately on Arch there are two [AUR](/index.php/AUR "AUR")-[PKGBUILD](/index.php/PKGBUILD "PKGBUILD") files available that allow you to build it without much hassle.

The first one is [edelib](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/edelib/) which is a dependency for EDE, the other one [ede](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ede/) the actual DE.

## Starting the DE

To bring up EDE you can either use a [Display manager](/index.php/Display_manager "Display manager") or use startx. If you choose the later, just write the following to the .xinitrc of your user:

```
 exec startede

```

## Applications

Since EDE is a bare-bone DE, you will have to add even the most common applications like a file manager or an editor yourself. It's all your freedom and choice.

Due to the nature of the DE, it obviously makes sense to install light-weight software. There are however not that many [FLTK](http://fltk.org) applications available so you will likely have to relay on a second toolkit like [GTK+](/index.php/GTK%2B "GTK+") for example.

### Some recommendations

*   File manager: [PCManFM](/index.php/PCManFM "PCManFM")
*   Browser: [Dillo](/index.php/Dillo "Dillo") or [Midori](/index.php/Midori "Midori")
*   Editor: [Leafpad](http://tarot.freeshell.org/leafpad/)
*   Terminal emulator: [Xterm](/index.php/Xterm "Xterm")
