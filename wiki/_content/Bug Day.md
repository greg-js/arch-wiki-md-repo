## About

Bug Day is a day dedicated to raising awareness about our overflowing [bug tracker](https://bugs.archlinux.org/). The goal of the day is to get the community involved in trying to help us eliminate as many bugs as possible.

### When?

Bug Day happens whenever a developer gets bored.

### Where?

The bugs themselves are documented on the [bug tracker](https://bugs.archlinux.org)

Discussion about the bugs should be taking place in **#archlinux-bugs** on [IRC](/index.php/IRC "IRC"). We will try to have at least one developer active during bug day.

### Who?

**Everyone** is allowed, invited, and encouraged to participate in Bug Day.
