Modoboa is a mail hosting and management platform including a modern and simplified Web User Interface. It provides useful components such as an administration panel or a webmail.

Modoboa integrates with well known software such as [Postfix](/index.php/Postfix "Postfix") and/or [Dovecot](/index.php/Dovecot "Dovecot"). A SQL database ([MySQL](/index.php/MySQL "MySQL") or [PostgreSQL](/index.php/PostgreSQL "PostgreSQL")) is used as a central point of communication between all components. Modoboa is developed with modularity in mind, expanding it is really easy. Actually, all current features are extensions.

A full list of features can be viewed at [Modoboa features page](http://modoboa.org/en/features/) and screenshoots is available at [Modoboa screenshoots page](http://modoboa.org/en/screenshots/).

It is written in [Python](/index.php/Python "Python") and uses the [Django](/index.php/Django "Django"), jQuery and Bootstrap frameworks.
