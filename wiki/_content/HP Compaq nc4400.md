# HP Compaq nc4400

From ArchWiki

Jump to: [navigation](#column-one), [search](#searchInput)

I wanted a small and fast laptop that's capable of running Linux. My choice was a HP Compaq nc4400. This HP and the Lenovo Thinkpad have a lot in common, for example they both sport a pointing stick and both lack an optical (cd/dvd) drive. My goal was to leave the pre-installed WinXP on the laptop and install Arch from an usb stick since I do not own an USB cd/dvd drive.

## What works/what does not

Pretty much everything needed works when you tweak. This wiki is an excellent source of infomation.Â :) On windows the network controller (nextreme) can be "safely removed" to save power. I think you can do the same in linux with "rmmod tg3".

For the right console display size I set vga=792 (1024x768x16M@60Hz) as a kernel boot parameter.

There's hardware mute and volume up/down buttons. They work but odly every time I reboot it's always back to mute. More like a feature than a bug.

The `Fn+brighter/dimmer` display buttons and the Ambient Light Sensor work software independent.

In my understanding, the TPM doesn't show anywhere even tho there's a kernel module for the infineon TPM. I haven't tried to make it work and probably won't even try. I believe the Irda and modem work as expected, haven't tested.

I haven't tried to use an external monitor/TV, I expect making those work is just matter of confing.

The ICH7 family sports a hpet multimedia timer that saves power. Kernel boot parameter hpet=force just in case.

Bluetooth works (kdebluetooth, but probably also gnome-bluetooth).

CPU frequency scaling works. (cpufrequtils with the p4_clockmod module).

## Xorg configuration

The i810 driver works for graphics. [xf86-video-intel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xf86-video-intel) package is needed.

Use [Touchpad Synaptics](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics "Touchpad Synaptics") to tune the touthpad.

## Wifi

The wireless card requires the _iwlegacy_ kernel module. See [Wireless network configuration#iwlegacy](/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration#iwlegacy "Wireless network configuration")

## SD/MMC memory card reader

This works with the tifm driver.

```
modprobe tifm_core
modprobe tifm_7xx1
modprobe tifm_sd

```

Or you can enable them at boot from a file in `/etc/modules.d/`.

## HDD failing sensors

See the [S.M.A.R.T.](/index.php/S.M.A.R.T. "S.M.A.R.T.") howto. This line in `/etc/smartd.conf` does the job for me (Tkjacobsen):

```
/dev/sda -a -d sat -m root@localhost

```

### ToDo

*   The fingerprint reader is via USB, haven't looked into that yet either.
