### Arch Installation

I used the FTP method to install Arch and thus I thought it wouldn't make much difference if I used 0.7.2 ISO, but guess what? It doesn't work well!

Might be because of the kernel (2.6.16) since this laptop is really picky when it comes to kernel version (as I'll explain later), everything seems to be working alright until you start formating the partitions you want, then it takes ages to just write a few blocks on the disk!

So I strongly advise for everyone with these model (and this might be true with all the dv6000t series as well) to use, at least, the 0.8beta1 ISO instead.

Apart from this detail, the installation went pretty smoothly.

### Kernel

If you use kernel older than 2.6.20 you'll need to use noacpi or acpi=noirq parameters to boot.

### Touchpad

There isn't much to say, just follow the [Touchpad Synaptics](/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics "Touchpad Synaptics") entry.

### cpufreq

Section 2.1 of [SpeedStep](/index.php/SpeedStep "SpeedStep") entry has pretty much what you need but notice, as it's said in section 1 on the same entry, that since you're using kernel >= 2.6.20 the speedstep_centrino module is redundant so just load acpi_cpufreq instead.

Also I advise the use of "conservative" governor because it saves battery since it will always stay on the lowest frequency supported until the cpu use justifies an increase in it's frequency (it's a dual core cpu so believe me, you won't need to have it always on maxÂ :)).

The values of min and max frequency should be:

```
# valid freq suffixes: Hz, kHz (default), MHz, GHz, THz
 min_freq="1.0GHz"
 max_freq="1.83GHz"

```

### Sound

Works fine with the newer versions of alsa.

Also there's a problem with suspend2ram, as stated in [stalwart's blog](http://stalwart.hopto.org/~stalwart/?page_id=90), when waking up from suspend the sound form jack doesn't work anymore. I haven't tested with the newer versions of alsa though.

### Wireless

Just follow section 2.1.6 of [Wireless](/index.php/Wireless "Wireless") entry for drivers instalation and then section 3 for setup.

### Webcam

**OUTDATED! This stopped working after some updates (kernel I think)**

You'll need uvcvideo module, once you have it and it's in use you'll see a /dev/video0 entry in your system.

To test it use luvcview

```
# luvcview -d /dev/video0 -f yuv

```

Or use ekiga.

### Quickplay buttons

If you use KDE this can be done easily, just go to Control Center -> Regional & Accessibility -> Keyboard Layout and choose Hewlett-Packard Pavillion ZT11xx layout and most of the QuickPlay buttons as well as fn keys will work.

If you do not use KDE or want more information about keybinding just check Gentoo's Wiki entry on [Multimedia Keys](http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Use_Multimedia_Keys), it's really helpful.

### Card Reader

Seems to work fine out-of-the-box.

### Sensors

sensors-detect detects 3 modules: i2c-i801, eeprom and coretemp but Ksensors only has 2 coretemp entries (concerning the cpus) but no sensors are detected.

Still trying to get it working properly.
