MediaWiki supports [full text search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_text_search "wikipedia:full text search"). The limitations of this feature is that it indexes only words longer than 3 characters. If you want to search for shorter words (1 to 3 characters) then a known workaround is to use [Google](http://www.google.com/custom?domains=wiki.archlinux.org&sitesearch=wiki.archlinux.org)'s _sitesearch_ feature. Enter your search items in the form and it will automatically search within ArchWiki.

Of course, you can do the same manually by appending `site:wiki.archlinux.org` to Google searches:

```
your search items site:wiki.archlinux.org

```

This works fine, but it is not live. Google is indexing the ArchWiki every 1 to 3 days.

## DuckDuckGo Bangs

You can also use [DuckDuckGo's bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html) feature to directly search the Arch Wiki. After adding DuckDuckGo as the default search engine of your web browser, you can directly type something like the following in the omnibox / URL bar:

 `!archwiki <your_search_term>` 

or, shorter

 `!aw <your_search_term>`
